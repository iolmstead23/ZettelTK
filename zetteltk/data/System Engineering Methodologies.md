Early approaches to system engineering used the _**waterfall model**_, following the development process sequentially: first requirements analysis, then design and implementation, and finally testing. Each step needed to be finished before moving on to the next. New models have evolved to reflect the natural trial-and-error creative process of problem-solving. Using the incremental model, the system is constructed in increments. The first increment is a simplified version of the final product. As tests are completed, more features are added and tested incrementally until the system is complete. If a patient record system is being developed for a hospital, the first increment might incorporate only the ability to view a small sample of patient records. Additional features would be available when this version is operational, such as the ability to add and update records.

_**Prototyping**_ is building and evaluating basic versions of a proposed system. Rapid prototyping involves quickly constructing a simple sample that may consist of only a few screen images, indicating how the system would [[function]]. Rapid prototyping is used to build a "rough draft" of a product, with minimal resources and effort, giving stakeholders a clear picture of the intended system.

Open-source development permits users to modify the [[Software|software]] code. Possibly the most notable example is the [[Linux]] [[Operating System|operating system]]. Although most [[software]] from Microsoft is closed source (meaning the code cannot be modified), PowerShell Core was made open source in 2016. Under the open-source model, applications are developed and shared to be downloaded, used, and updated by a local or even global community of enthusiasts.
### Agile Methodologies

Agile methods are system development methodologies that propose incremental implementations, respond to rapidly changing requirements, and reduce the emphasis on rigorous requirements. Scrum and extreme programming are both examples of agile methodologies.

Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple steps:

1. The system owner makes a prioritized wish list.
2. The scrum team selects an item toward the top of the wish list and plans the implementation during an event called "sprint."
3. The team completes the list of objectives while assessing progress in daily meetings called scrums.
4. The sprint ends with the system ready to be released.
5. A new sprint starts, using another item on the wish list.
6. This process continues until the prioritized wish list is clear.

Following the extreme programming (XP) model, systems are developed by a team of fewer than a dozen individuals working in a communal workspace, where they freely share ideas and assist each other in the development project. The system is developed incrementally by repeated daily cycles of informal requirements analyses, designs, and common tests. New, expanded versions of the system appear on a regular basis. Each version is usually evaluated by the project stakeholders.

Agile development is quick, increases customer satisfaction, values employees, and reduces rework.
