Encryption is the process of converting [[information]] (plaintext) into a secure coded form (ciphertext) that can only be decoded by authorized parties. This fundamental concept of cryptography has ancient roots but has evolved into a cornerstone of modern digital security. At its core, encryption uses [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[algorithm|algorithms ]]and keys to transform [[data]] in a way that makes it unreadable without the proper decryption method.

# Historical Context and Evolution

The journey of encryption begins with simple substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. If we represent this mathematically, for a shift of $k$ positions, each letter at position $x$ is transformed to: $E(x) = (x + k) \bmod 26$. This historical perspective helps us appreciate how encryption has evolved from basic letter substitution to complex mathematical algorithms that protect our digital world today.

# Fundamental Types of Encryption

Modern encryption broadly falls into two categories: symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, represented as: $D_k(E_k(M)) = M$, where $E_k$ is the encryption [[function]] with key $k$, $D_k$ is the decryption [[function]], and $M$ is the message. Asymmetric encryption uses different but mathematically related keys for encryption and decryption, typically represented as: $D_{private}(E_{public}(M)) = M$.

# Mathematical Foundations

The security of modern encryption relies on complex mathematical problems. Public key cryptography, for instance, often uses the difficulty of factoring large numbers. The RSA [[algorithm]] bases its security on the fact that while calculating $n = p × q$ is simple, finding $p$ and $q$ given only $n$ is computationally intensive when $p$ and $q$ are very large [[prime numbers]]. The encryption process in RSA can be represented as: $C = M^e \bmod n$, where $C$ is the ciphertext, $M$ is the message, and $e$ is the public exponent.

# Block Ciphers and Modes of Operation

Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks of [[data]], typically 128 or 256 bits. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a prominent example, processing [[data]] in a series of rounds, each involving substitution and permutation operations. The mathematical representation of a basic block cipher encryption is: $C_i = E_k(P_i)$, where $C_i$ is the $i$th block of ciphertext and $P_i$ is the $i$th block of plaintext.

# Stream Ciphers and Random Number Generation

Stream ciphers encrypt [[data]] one bit or byte at a time, often using a pseudorandom keystream. The encryption process can be represented as: $C_i = P_i \oplus K_i$, where $\oplus$ represents the XOR operation, and $K_i$ is the keystream. The security of these systems heavily depends on the quality of the random number generator used to create the keystream.

# Key Management and Distribution

The security of any encryption system ultimately depends on key management. In public key infrastructure (PKI), digital certificates help manage and distribute public keys. The mathematical relationship between public $(e,n)$ and private $(d,n)$ keys in RSA is maintained through the equation: $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$, where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient [[function]].

# Common Encryption [[Protocols]]

Modern security [[protocols]] like TLS (Transport Layer Security) combine various encryption methods to provide secure communication. During a TLS handshake, asymmetric encryption is used to exchange a symmetric key, which then encrypts the actual [[data]] transmission. This hybrid approach balances security with performance.

# Applications in [[Computer Science]]

Encryption finds widespread use in various computing applications. In [[database]] security, transparent [[data]] encryption (TDE) protects [[data]] at rest. In [[networks|network]] security, [[protocols]] like WPA3 use encryption to protect wireless communications. The strength of these systems often depends on the key size, where the security level typically increases exponentially with key length.

# Future of Encryption

Quantum computing poses both threats and opportunities for encryption. While it threatens to break current public key systems through Shor's algorithm, it also enables quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. The mathematical basis for quantum cryptography relies on the properties of quantum states, where measuring an unknown quantum state inevitably disturbs it, represented by the uncertainty principle: $\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$.
