Indexing is a fundamental [[data]] organization technique that optimizes [[data]] retrieval operations by creating additional [[data structure|data structures]] to enable quick access to records in a [[database]] or [[data structure|data structure]]. Much like a book's index allows readers to quickly locate specific topics, [[computer]]-based indexes provide efficient pathways to access [[data]] without scanning every record sequentially. The primary goal of indexing is to minimize disk I/O operations and reduce the computational overhead of [[data]] retrieval operations.

## Types of Indexes

### Primary Index

Primary indexes are built on the primary key fields of a [[database]] table. The index entries are arranged in the same sequential order as the [[data]] file records. Each entry contains the primary key value and a pointer to the corresponding [[data]] record. In a dense primary index, there is one index entry for every record in the [[data]] file. The relationship between primary index and [[data]] file maintains a one-to-one correspondence, ensuring unique identification and retrieval of records.

### Secondary Index

Secondary indexes provide alternative access paths to [[data]] using non-primary key fields. Unlike primary indexes, secondary indexes can be created on fields that contain duplicate values. They maintain a many-to-one relationship between index entries and [[data]] records. Secondary indexes are particularly useful for queries that frequently access records based on non-key attributes, though they require additional storage space and maintenance overhead during [[data]] modifications.

### Clustering Index

Clustering indexes physically order [[data]] records based on a non-key field. They are particularly effective when records need to be accessed in a specific order or when range queries are common. Only one clustering index can exist per table since the records can only be physically ordered in one way. The clustering factor measures how well the [[data]] is clustered according to the index, with a higher clustering factor indicating better physical organization.

## Index [[Data]] Structures

### B-Trees and B+ Trees

B-trees and B+ trees are the most commonly used [[data structure|data structures]] for implementing indexes. B-trees maintain a balanced tree structure where each node contains multiple key values and pointers. The structure ensures logarithmic [[time complexity]] for search, insert, and delete operations. B+ trees enhance B-trees by storing all [[data]] records in leaf nodes and linking these nodes together, making range queries more efficient. The typical fanout of a B-tree node is chosen to optimize disk I/O operations, often making each node the size of a disk block.

### Hash-Based Indexes

Hash-based indexes use hash functions to map key values to bucket addresses. They excel at point queries where exact match searches are required. The [[hash function]] distributes keys uniformly across buckets to minimize collisions. While hash indexes provide O(1) access time for equality searches, they do not support range queries efficiently. Dynamic hashing techniques like extensible hashing and linear hashing allow the index to grow and shrink as needed.

## Performance Considerations

### Space-Time Tradeoffs

Index structures introduce a space overhead in exchange for improved query performance. The space requirement includes both the index entries and associated structural [[information]]. For large databases, the cumulative size of indexes can become significant. [[Database]] administrators must carefully balance the benefits of faster queries against the storage costs and maintenance overhead of additional indexes.

### Maintenance Overhead

Indexes must be updated whenever the underlying [[data]] changes. Insert, update, and delete operations on the base table require corresponding modifications to all associated indexes. This maintenance overhead can impact the performance of write-intensive workloads. Some [[database]] systems defer index updates or rebuild indexes periodically to amortize the maintenance cost.

## Advanced Indexing Techniques

### Bitmap Indexes

Bitmap indexes are specialized structures suited for fields with low [[cardinality]] (few distinct values). They represent each possible value as a bit [[vector]], where each bit indicates whether a record contains that value. Bitmap indexes excel at handling complex queries involving multiple conditions through efficient bitwise operations. They are particularly effective in [[data]] warehousing and analytical processing scenarios.

### Multi-dimensional Indexes

Multi-dimensional indexes handle queries involving multiple attributes simultaneously. Structures like R-trees and quadtrees partition the multi-dimensional space to enable efficient spatial queries. These indexes are crucial in geographic [[information]] systems, scientific databases, and multimedia applications where [[data]] has inherent spatial or temporal relationships.

## Query [[Optimization]] and Index Selection

### Index Selection Problem

Choosing the optimal set of indexes for a given workload is a complex [[optimization]] problem. The selection process must consider query patterns, update frequencies, storage constraints, and maintenance costs. Automated index selection tools analyze query workloads and recommend index configurations that maximize performance while respecting system constraints.

### Query Plan Generation

Query optimizers use available indexes to generate efficient execution plans. The optimizer considers factors such as index selectivity, access patterns, and join operations to determine whether and how to use indexes in query execution. Understanding index [[statistics]] and cost models is crucial for predicting query performance and making informed [[optimization]] decisions.
