Sharing [[information]] and resources through linked [[computer]] systems is called networking. This enables users to exchange messages and share resources, such as printers, [[Software|software]] packages, and [[data]] storage devices. Network [[software]] and its configurations manage the operations of the [[networks|network]] interfaces. We will investigate how to effectively design, manage, and secure [[Networks|networks]].
### Network Types

[[Networks]] are commonly classified based on the physical distance between components (geographic scope). According to this classification, there are three major categories of [[networks]]: personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), and wide area network (WAN).
#### PAN

A PAN is normally used for short-range communications, within a few feet, such as wireless headphones to a smartphone or a wireless mouse to a PC
#### LAN

LANs consist of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex. For example, the computers in a manufacturing building may be connected via a LAN.
#### WAN

WANs link systems over a greater distance, including machines on the opposite sides of the world.
