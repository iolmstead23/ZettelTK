[[Networks]] are systems of [[hardware]] and [[Software|software]] components that connect two or more devices for the purpose of sharing [[data]] and [[information]].

There are two common types of networks: local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). LANs span a single home, school, or small office building and provide a connection for devices that are within the same network. WANs reach across cities, states, or even across the world. The internet is the worldâ€™s largest public wide area network.

[[Computer]] networks differ in design. The two types of network design include client-to-server and peer-to-peer. An example of a client-server implementation are servers on one side of the network running authentication to facilitate millions of users logging in and permitting access to specific resources based on parameters such as username, password, and system identifiers. In a peer-to-peer network, all devices tend to support the same functions. Access to resources is provided without the assistance of a server. BitTorrent is a protocol that enables peer-to-peer file sharing. Client-server networks are common across organizations and peer-to-peer networks are common in small offices and homes.

### Physical [[Topology]]
Identifying how [[data]] flows is an important part of designing a network and is commonly drawn out using two different perspectives: logical and physical. This figure shows a physical [[topology]], which is the actual layout of how systems are placed in the network.

### Logical [[Topology]]
This figure is a logical [[topology]]. This form of a [[topology]] indicates how the [[data]] actually flow and is extremely important when considering things like load balancing normal traffic, network backups, and replication of [[data]].

Networks may implement various types of topologies. The most common network [[topology]] layouts are bus, star, ring, and mesh.

Languages supporting [[data]] exchange between computers are referred to as [[Protocols|protocols]]. Different networks may support different [[protocols]]. The most popular protocol is TCP/IP and is commonly found on the internet and in home networks.

Special-purpose [[computer]] systems include network routers, access points, and switches. These devices, along with cable media such as fiber optic and Ethernet, make it possible for devices to communicate with each other. Network operating systems and other [[software]] applications generate network traffic and enable users to complete tasks.
