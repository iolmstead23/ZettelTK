## Definition

A direct proof is a logical method of proving a mathematical statement by starting with known facts and using logical reasoning to reach the conclusion.

## Structure

1. **Assume Hypothesis**
    - Start with given conditions or premises
    - Clearly state initial assumptions
2. **Logical Deduction**
    - Apply step-by-step logical reasoning
    - Use established [[mathematics|mathematical]] rules
    - Transform initial statements
3. **Reach Conclusion**
    - Demonstrate the original statement is true
    - Verify through logical steps

## Key Characteristics

- Uses forward reasoning
- Builds from known facts to desired conclusion
- Relies on established mathematical principles
- Most straightforward proof technique

## Example

**Proof: If x is an even integer, then x² is even**

Proof:

- Let x be an even integer
- By definition, x = 2k for some integer k
- x² = (2k)² = 4k²
- 4k² can be written as 2(2k²)
- Therefore, x² is even

## When to Use

- Simple, straightforward statements
- Relationships with clear logical progression
- Mathematical propositions with direct connections

## Advantages

- Intuitive approach
- Easy to understand
- Directly demonstrates truth

## Limitations

- Not suitable for complex or indirect relationships
- Requires clear logical path
