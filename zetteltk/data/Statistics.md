Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting [[data]]. This field serves as the backbone of empirical research across virtually every scientific discipline, from psychology to physics, from medicine to marketing. At its heart, statistics provides us with the tools to make sense of the world through [[data]].

## Types of Statistics

The field of statistics is broadly divided into two main branches: descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics helps us summarize and describe [[data]] sets through measures of central tendency and dispersion. Inferential statistics allows us to draw conclusions about populations based on sample [[data]].

### Descriptive Statistics

The central tendency of a dataset can be measured in several ways. The [[arithmetic]] mean ($\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$) provides the average value, while the median represents the middle value when [[data]] is ordered. The mode indicates the most frequent value in a dataset.

Measures of dispersion tell us about the spread of our [[data]]. The variance ($s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$) and its square root, the standard deviation, quantify how far values typically deviate from the mean. The range, interquartile range, and percentiles provide alternative measures of spread.

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics uses [[probability]] theory to draw conclusions about populations. The [[central limit theorem]] serves as a foundational principle, stating that the sampling distribution of means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases. This theorem is expressed as:

$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

where $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ is the standard error of the mean, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.

## [[Data]] Types and Measurement Scales

Understanding [[data]] types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical analyses. We classify [[data]] into:

1. Nominal: Categorical [[data]] with no natural order
2. Ordinal: Categorical [[data]] with a natural order
3. Interval: Numerical [[data]] with meaningful intervals but no true zero
4. Ratio: Numerical [[data]] with meaningful intervals and a true zero

## Statistical Distributions

The normal distribution, often called the bell curve, plays a central role in statistics. Its [[probability]] density [[function]] is:

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

Other important distributions include the t-distribution, chi-square distribution, and F-distribution, each serving specific purposes in statistical analysis.

## Modern Applications and Big [[Data]]

Contemporary statistics has evolved with the advent of big [[data]] and [[machine learning]]. Modern statistical methods often incorporate:

- Robust [[regression]] techniques
- [[Machine learning]] algorithms
- Bayesian methods
- High-dimensional [[data]] analysis
- Time series analysis
