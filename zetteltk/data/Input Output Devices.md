Input devices translate [[data]] into a form that the [[computer]] can understand, and output devices translate [[information]] into a form that humans can understand.

The keyboard is the most common input device. Direct input devices such as pointing devices (mouse and trackball) and scanning devices (bar code readers) are much faster and have less room for error compared to the keyboard. Styluses, cameras, and microphones are input devices more commonly used in smartphones.

Monitors and printers are the most common **output devices**. Monitors present the output on a screen, and printers produce hard copies on paper. Other examples of output devices include speakers, 3D printers, and projectors.

Identify the I/O devices attached to [[The System Unit|the system unit]] of the machine you are using. Consider how each device supports your communication with the [[computer]] system.
### Communication Devices

**Communication devices** allow a [[computer]] to send and receive [[data]] to and from other computers. Modems send [[information]] over a phone line or [[Coaxial Cable|coaxial cable]], whereas a [[networks|network]] card sends [[information]] over dedicated network cables. Satellite, wireless, and Bluetooth technologies enable [[data]] to be transmitted without the need for physical wires. Satellite communication uses radio signals and orbiting satellites to receive and send [[data]] from one system to another. Bluetooth adapters facilitate wireless communication between electronic devices. Common devices that use Bluetooth include hands-free earpieces, wireless keyboards, mouses, and microphones.
