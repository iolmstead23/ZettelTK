The Quotient Rule is a [[Differentiation|differentiation]] technique in [[Calculus|calculus]] used to find the [[Derivative|derivative]] of a [[function]] that is the quotient of two other functions. For two differentiable functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x)≠0$, the Quotient Rule states that the [[derivative]] of the quotient $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$​ is given by:$$\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)})=\frac {f′(x)g(x)−f(x)g′(x)}{\lvert g(x) \rvert^2}$$
In essence, the Quotient Rule can be remembered as “low $g(x)$ times the [[derivative]] of the top $f(x)$, minus top $f(x)$ times the [[derivative]] of the low $g(x)$, all over the square of the bottom.” This rule is essential when working with ratios of polynomials or functions in algebraic and [[calculus]] problems, particularly in fields where rate-based comparisons are necessary, like physics or economics.

Historically, the Quotient Rule, like the Product and Chain Rules, originated with foundational [[calculus]] concepts developed by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the late 17th century. The rule was refined as [[calculus]] evolved, particularly during the 19th century, when mathematicians like Augustin-Louis Cauchy formalized these methods, ensuring the rigorous and systematic framework we use today. The Quotient Rule remains fundamental for problems involving divisions of functions in advanced [[calculus]], analysis, and applied [[mathematics]].
