Natural numbers, denoted by NN, are the most fundamental set of numbers used for counting and ordering. They typically start from 1 (i.e., N={1,2,3,… }N={1,2,3,…}), though some definitions include 0. Natural numbers are discrete and form the basis for [[arithmetic]] operations like addition and multiplication. In [[computer science]], natural numbers are ubiquitous. For example, they are used in loop iterations (`for i in 1 to n`), array [[indexing]], and [[algorithm]] analysis, where the number of steps in an [[algorithm]] is often expressed as a [[function]] of n. In cryptography, natural numbers play a critical role in prime number-based [[encryption]] systems like RSA. In [[discrete mathematics]], natural numbers are essential for [[combinatorics]], such as counting [[permutations]] of n objects, and for [[mathematics|mathematical]] induction, a proof technique that relies on the well-ordered property of natural numbers.
