The **Mean Value Theorem (MVT)** is a fundamental theorem in [[Calculus|calculus]], stating that for any continuous and differentiable [[function]] over a closed interval $(a, b)$, there exists at least one point $c$ in $(a, b)$ where the instantaneous rate of change (or [[Derivative|derivative]]) of the [[function]] equals the average rate of change over the interval.

In formal terms, if $f(x)$ is continuous on $(a, b)$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that: $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

This equation shows that the slope of the tangent line at $c$ the [[derivative]], $f'(c)$ is parallel to the line connecting the endpoints of the interval, known as the secant line. 

**Key Points:**
1. **Conditions**: The [[function]] \(f(x)\) must be continuous on $(a,b)$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$.
2. **Parallel Tangent**: The theorem guarantees at least one point $c$ where the tangent line at $c$is parallel to the secant line joining $(a, f(a))$and $(b, f(b))$.
3. **Applications**: MVT is useful in proving other important theorems and in analyzing [[function]] behaviors, including understanding rates of change, estimating [[function]] values, and solving real-world problems where the rate is involved.

In essence, MVT provides a connection between average and instantaneous rates of change, illustrating that for a smooth, continuous path, there must be a point where the [[function]]'s behavior matches the average behavior over the interval.
