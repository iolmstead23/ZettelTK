In key-value databases (also referred to as stores), each item in the [[Database|database]] is stored as an attribute name (or key) together with its value. [[Graph]] stores are used to store [[information]] about [[Networks|networks]] of [[data]], such as social connections. Wide-column stores are optimized for queries on large [[data]] sets and store columns of [[data]] together, instead of in rows. Document-format databases pair each key with a complex [[data]] structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs.

_**NoSQL**_, which is short for not only SQL, databases can accommodate a wide variety of [[data]] models, including key-value, document, columnar, and [[graph]] formats. NoSQL is an alternative to traditional [[Relational Databases|relational databases]] in which [[data]] is placed in tables that are carefully designed before the [[database]] is built. NoSQL databases are especially useful for working with large sets of distributed [[data]].
