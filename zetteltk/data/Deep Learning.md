Deep learning represents a sophisticated subset of [[machine learning]] that employs artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. The fundamental principle behind deep learning lies in its ability to automatically learn representations of [[data]] with multiple levels of abstraction. This approach has revolutionized various fields, from computer vision to natural language processing, by achieving unprecedented levels of accuracy in complex tasks.

## Mathematical Foundations

### [[Linear Algebra]] Fundamentals

The backbone of deep learning rests firmly on [[linear algebra]]. [[matrix|Matrices]] and vectors form the basic building blocks of [[neural network]] operations. In deep learning, we represent inputs, weights, and outputs as matrices and vectors. A basic [[neural network]] layer performs the operation $Y = WX + b$, where $W$ represents the weight [[matrix]], $X$ is the input [[vector]], $b$ is the bias [[vector]], and $Y$ is the output [[vector]]. [[Matrix]] operations become particularly important when dealing with batch processing, where multiple inputs are processed simultaneously.

The concept of [[vector space|vector spaces]] plays a crucial role in understanding how neural networks transform [[data]]. Each layer of a [[neural network]] can be viewed as a transformation from one [[vector space]] to another, represented by the [[function]] $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, where $n$ is the input dimension and $m$ is the output dimension.

### [[Calculus]] in Deep Learning

[[Calculus]] provides the mathematical framework for optimizing neural networks. The gradient descent [[algorithm]], fundamental to [[neural network]] training, relies heavily on multivariate [[calculus]]. The [[chain rule]], in particular, forms the basis of backpropagation, expressed as:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_i} = \sum_j \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_j} \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial w_i}$

where $L$ represents the [[loss function]], $w_i$ are the weights, and $y_j$ are the outputs. The partial derivatives guide the network in adjusting its weights to minimize the [[loss function]].

## [[Neural Network]] Architecture

### Feed-Forward Neural Networks

The basic architecture of a feed-forward [[neural network]] involves layers of neurons connected in [[sequence]]. Each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs followed by a non-linear activation function:

$z = \sigma(\sum_i w_i x_i + b)$

where $\sigma$ represents the activation function (such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh), $w_i$ are the weights, $x_i$ are the inputs, and $b$ is the bias term.

### [[covolutional neural network|Convolutional Neural Networks]]

CNNs have transformed computer vision by introducing specialized layers that exploit spatial relationships in [[data]]. The convolution operation can be expressed as:

$S(i,j) = (K * I)(i,j) = \sum_m \sum_n K(m,n)I(i-m,j-n)$

where $K$ represents the [[kernel]] and $I$ represents the input image. This operation enables the network to detect features like edges, textures, and complex patterns hierarchically.

## Training Dynamics

### [[loss function|Loss Functions]] and [[Optimization]]

The training process involves minimizing a [[loss function]] that quantifies the difference between predicted and actual outputs. Common loss functions include:

Mean Squared Error: $MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ Cross-Entropy Loss: $H = -\sum_i y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$

[[Optimization]] algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) iteratively update network parameters:

$w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha \nabla L(w_t)$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\nabla L(w_t)$ is the gradient of the [[loss function]].

## Applications in Various Fields

### Computer Vision

Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks including object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition. Modern architectures like ResNet introduce skip connections to allow for deeper [[networks]]:

$H(x) = F(x) + x$

where $F(x)$ represents the residual mapping to be learned.

### Natural Language Processing

Transformer architectures have become fundamental in NLP tasks, utilizing self-attention mechanisms defined by:

$Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$

where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ represent queries, keys, and values respectively, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the keys.

### [[Reinforcement Learning]]

Deep [[reinforcement learning]] combines neural networks with [[reinforcement learning]] principles. The Q-learning update rule becomes:

$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max_{a'}Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$

where $s$ represents states, $a$ represents actions, $r$ is the reward, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

## Regularization and [[Optimization]] Techniques

Modern deep learning employs various regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training with [[probability]] $p$, effectively training an ensemble of neural networks. Batch normalization normalizes layer inputs:

$\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}$

where $\mu_B$ and $\sigma_B^2$ are the batch mean and variance, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability.
