Computers are categorized based on their size and processing speed.

**Supercomputers** are the biggest and fastest computers, designed to process huge amounts of [[data]]. They are built as a system of thousands of interconnected processors. Supercomputers are particularly useful in scientific and engineering applications such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research.

**Mainframe computers** are designed to support hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously. They also support multiple programs at the same time, making them useful to big organizations that manage and process high volumes of [[data]].

A **workstation** is a single-user [[computer]] designed for technical or scientific applications. It has a faster microprocessor, a large amount of RAM, and high-speed graphics cards. It generally performs a specific job with great expertise. Graphics, music, and engineering design departments often use this type of system.

A **microcomputer** is more commonly known as a personal [[computer]]. It is a general-purpose [[computer]] for individual use. It has a memory, storage, input and output units, and a microprocessor as a [[Central Processing Unit|central processing unit]]. Desktops, laptops, and handheld or mobile devices are all microcomputers.
