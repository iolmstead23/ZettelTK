Set theory is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies collections of objects, called sets. Sets can contain numbers, symbols, or other elements, and they are fundamental to nearly every area of [[mathematics]].

### **Brief History of Set Theory**

- **Origins**: Set theory was formalized by German mathematician **Georg Cantor** in the late 19th century. Cantor introduced the idea of comparing the sizes of infinite sets and developed concepts such as [[cardinality]] and ordinality.
- **Development**: Cantor's work initially faced skepticism but later became foundational for modern [[mathematics]], particularly in logic, [[topology]], and analysis.
- **Axiomatic Approach**: In the early 20th century, set theory was formalized with axioms to address paradoxes like Russell's Paradox. The most widely used system today is the **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZF)**, often paired with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC).
### **Uses of Set Theory**

- **[[Mathematics]]**: Forms the basis of almost every branch, including [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[calculus]].
- **Logic and [[Computer]] Science**: Used to model logical statements, design algorithms, and develop databases.
- **[[Data Science]]**: Helps in defining and manipulating [[data]] collections.
- **Philosophy**: Provides a framework for understanding infinity and logical foundations.
### **Set Theory Notation**

- **Basic Notation**:
    
    - A set is denoted using curly braces: $\{ \}$.
    - Example: $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ represents a set with elements 1, 2, and 3.
- **Membership**:
    
    - $x \in A$: $x$ is an element of set $A$.
    - $x \notin A$: $x$ is not an element of set $A$.
- **Subset**:
    
    - $A \subseteq B$: $A$ is a subset of $B$ (all elements of $A$ are in $B$).
    - $A \subset B$: $A$ is a proper subset of BBB (all elements of $A$ are in $B$, but $B$ has additional elements).
- **Set Operations**:
    
    - **Union**: $A \cup B$ is the set of elements in $A$, $B$, or both.
    - **Intersection**: $A \cap B$ is the set of elements common to $A$ and $B$.
    - **Difference**: $A - B$ is the set of elements in $A$ but not in $B$.
    - **Complement**: $\overline{A}$ is the set of all elements not in $A$.
- **Special Sets**:
    
    - Empty Set: $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$, a set with no elements.
    - Universal Set: The set containing all possible elements in a context.

### **Example Problem**

**Given**: $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

- Find $A \cup B$: $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
- Find $A \cap B$: $\{3, 4\}$.
- Find $A - B$: $\{1, 2\}$.
