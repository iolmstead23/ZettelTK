Real numbers, denoted by $R$, encompass all rational and [[irrational numbers]], forming a continuous number line. Examples include integers like 33, fractions like −2.5−2.5, and irrationals like 22​ and $\pi$. Real numbers are indispensable in [[calculus]], where they are used to define limits $\lim⁡ x→af(x)$, derivatives ($f′(x)= \frac {df}{dx}$​), and integrals ($\int ab​f(x)dx$). In physics, real numbers model continuous phenomena such as velocity, acceleration, and temperature. In [[computer]] graphics, real numbers represent coordinates, colors, and transformations in 3D space, often using floating-point [[arithmetic]]. The completeness property of real numbers ensures that every Cauchy [[sequence]] converges, making them ideal for modeling infinite processes.
