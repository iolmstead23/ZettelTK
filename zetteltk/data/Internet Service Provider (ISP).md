### The Three Tiers of ISPs

The individual [[Networks|networks]] comprising the internet are constructed and maintained by internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs are classified in tiers depending on the role they play in the overall internet structure.

Tier 1, at the top of the ISP hierarchy, is the least common type of ISP and serves as the backbone of the internet. Tier 1 ISPs consist of high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs that are typically operated by large communication companies.

Tier 2 ISPs are more common and regional in scope. Tier 1 and Tier 2 ISPs are essentially [[networks]] of routers that collectively provide the internetâ€™s communication infrastructure.

Tier 3 ISPs (access ISPs) are typically independent internets, sometimes called intranets, operated by a single organization that supplies internet access to homes and businesses. The devices used to connect to the access ISP are called end systems or hosts. These include common internet devices such as PCs, laptops, and smartphones, but also devices such as cameras, automobiles, and home appliances. A variety of technologies are used to connect end systems to larger [[networks]]. Common connecting technologies are telephone lines, cables, and satellites.
