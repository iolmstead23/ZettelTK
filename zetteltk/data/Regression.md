Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical method that examines relationships between variables, specifically how one or more independent variables influence a dependent variable. This powerful technique allows us to model, predict, and understand complex relationships in [[data]]. At its core, regression helps us answer questions about how changes in certain factors affect an outcome of interest.

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression models the relationship between two variables using a straight line. The mathematical form is:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$

where:

- $Y$ is the dependent variable
- $X$ is the independent variable
- $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept
- $\beta_1$ is the slope coefficient
- $\epsilon$ represents random error

The least squares method minimizes the sum of squared residuals to find the best-fitting line. The formula for the slope is:

$\beta_1 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends the simple model to include multiple independent variables:

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon$

This model allows us to:

- Account for multiple influencing factors
- Control for confounding variables
- Assess relative importance of predictors
- Make predictions based on multiple inputs

## Model Assessment and Diagnostics

Key metrics for evaluating regression models include:

1. R-squared ($R^2$): Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$
2. Adjusted R-squared: Penalizes additional predictors: $R^2_{adj} = 1 - (1-R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n}}$

## Assumptions and Diagnostics

Regression models rely on several key assumptions:

4. Linearity: The relationship between variables should be linear
5. Independence: Observations should be independent
6. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals
7. Normality: Residuals should be normally distributed
8. No multicollinearity: Independent variables shouldn't be highly correlated

## Advanced Regression Techniques

### [[Polynomial]] Regression

Extends linear regression to model curved relationships: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + ... + \beta_pX^p + \epsilon$

### Logistic Regression

Models binary outcomes using the logistic [[function]]: $P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)}}$

### Ridge Regression

Adds L2 regularization to prevent overfitting: $\min_{\beta} \sum(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum\beta_jx_{ij})^2 + \lambda\sum\beta_j^2$

### Lasso Regression

Uses L1 regularization for feature selection: $\min_{\beta} \sum(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum\beta_jx_{ij})^2 + \lambda\sum|\beta_j|$
