## Introduction to Proofs

A mathematical proof is a rigorous logical argument that demonstrates the truth of a mathematical statement. The foundation of any proof lies in using valid reasoning to move from known facts (axioms and previously proven theorems) to establish new [[mathematics|mathematical ]]truths.

## Key Components of a Proof

### 1. Statement Structure

- **[[hypothesis|Hypothesis]]**: The given condition or assumption (the "if" part)
- **Conclusion**: What needs to be proven (the "then" part)
- **Theorem**: The complete if-then statement

### 2. Logical Framework

- **Definitions**: Precise mathematical meanings of terms used
- **Axioms**: Basic assumptions accepted without proof
- **Previously proven theorems**: Results that can be used as building blocks

## Common Proof Techniques

### 1. [[Direct Proof]]

- Start with the hypothesis
- Use logical steps to reach the conclusion
- Best used when there's a clear path from hypothesis to conclusion
- Example structure:
    - Let [[Hypothesis]]
    - Then (Logical Step 1)
    - Therefore (Logical Step 2)
    - Thus [[Conclusion]]

### 2. [[Proof by Contrapositive]]

- Prove "if not Q, then not P" instead of "if P, then Q"
- Logically equivalent to the original statement
- Useful when the negation of the conclusion provides better starting point

Deciding whether to prove a conditional statement using a [[direct proof]] or a [[proof by contrapositive]] often involves some trial and error. The decision should be based on whether the hypothesis or the negation of the conclusion provides a more useful assumption to work with.

### 3. [[Proof by Contradiction]]

- Assume the statement is false
- Derive a logical contradiction
- Conclude the statement must be true
- Particularly useful for proving something doesn't exist or is unique

### 4. Mathematical Induction

- Base case: Prove true for initial value
- Inductive step: Prove if true for k, then true for k+1
- Conclude true for all values in the set
- Best for statements involving [[natural numbers]]

## Proof Writing Guidelines

### 1. Structure and Organization

- Begin with a clear statement of what's being proved
- Present steps in logical order
- Use appropriate notation consistently
- End with a clear conclusion

### 2. Level of Detail

- Include enough steps to make logic clear
- Explain major steps or transitions
- Reference theorems or definitions used
- Balance between brevity and clarity

### 3. Common Notation

- ∴ Therefore
- ∵ Because
- ⟹ Implies
- ⟺ If and only if
- ∀ For all
- ∃ There exists
- □ or ∎ End of proof

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Circular reasoning
2. Assuming what you're trying to prove
3. Using unproven statements
4. Making implicit assumptions
5. Overlooking edge cases
6. Insufficient justification for steps

## Verification Strategies

1. Check if each step logically follows
2. Verify all cases are covered
3. Test with simple examples
4. Look for gaps in reasoning
5. Ensure all terms are properly defined
6. Verify initial assumptions are valid

## Applications Across [[Mathematics]]

- **[[Discrete Mathematics]]**: [[Set Theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[graph theory]]
- **Analysis**: Limits, continuity, derivatives
- **[[Algebra]]**: Group theory, ring properties
- **[[Geometry]]**: Geometric relationships, transformations
- **Number Theory**: Properties of integers, divisibility

Remember: The goal of a proof is not just to show that something is true, but to explain why it must be true through logical reasoning.
