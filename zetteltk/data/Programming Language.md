Programming refers to writing step-by-step instructions that tell a [[computer]] how to perform specific actions. These instructions are implemented in the form of [[Software|software]], mobile apps, [[Desktop|desktop]] applications, and games. While computers can execute tasks far faster than humans, they do not understand human languages. Over time, we have developed various high-level programming languages that act as intermediaries, allowing us to communicate with computers more effectively.

**Programming languages** enable developers to write code that humans can understand (also known as **source code**). These high-level languages are more intuitive and closer to human reasoning compared to the [[computer]]'s native language, known as **machine code**, which consists of binary sequences (**0**'s and **1**'s). High-level languages like Python, Java, and C++ make programming easier and more efficient for developers.

However, computers only understand machine language. To bridge the gap, we need to translate the human-readable high-level code into binary. This translation process is accomplished through two primary tools:

1. **Compilers**: A [[Compiler|compiler]] translates the entire high-level program into machine code before execution. The result is a standalone executable file that can be run by the [[computer]].
   
2. **Interpreters**: An [[Interpreter|interpreter]], on the other hand, translates and executes the code line by line during runtime, rather than producing an entire executable file upfront. This allows for more dynamic execution but may be slower compared to compiled programs.

Programming languages can vary greatly in syntax and use cases. Some languages are better suited for system-level programming (e.g., C), while others excel in web development (e.g., JavaScript) or [[data]] analysis (e.g., Python).
