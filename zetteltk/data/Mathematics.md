Mathematics is the abstract study of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns, and it examines their relationships, structures, and changes. As a universal language for logical reasoning and problem-solving, mathematics is essential in many fields, allowing us to describe, analyze, and make predictions about real-world phenomena through logical deductions.
