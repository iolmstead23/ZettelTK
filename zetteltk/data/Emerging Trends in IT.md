### Mobile Computing

_**Mobile computing**_ is the use of handheld devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Due to the miniaturization of [[hardware]], mobile devices are approaching the computational capabilities and speed of larger computing systems, while continuously decreasing in size. The popularity of mobile computing devices continues to increase the demand for infrastructures that adequately support these needs.

### The Internet of Things (IoT)

Embedded and mechanical devices, objects, animals, and people are increasingly being provided with unique identifiers (UIDs), which provides the ability to transfer [[data]], or even funds, via a [[networks|network]]without the need for direct human interaction. This system of interconnected devices is known as the _**Internet of Things**_ (IoT). Smart home devices, wearables, and connected cars are examples of IoT devices. These items rely heavily on sensors and [[networks|network]] infrastructures to acquire and transmit [[data]] and possibly generate more new [[data]]. IoT is a notable emerging trend in IT because these devices can be attached to nearly anything and become components of a larger system.

### Globalization

The IT revolution is changing the way we communicate and process [[data]] and affecting the way we live, work, and play.

_**Globalization**_ refers to the growing interdependence of the world’s economies and cultures, brought about by the trade of goods and services and the flow of [[information]] and people. Advancements in [[computer]] [[hardware]], [[Software|software]], and networking have increased people’s ability to access [[information]] and reach economic potential. Internet applications change the way people use and share [[information]]. IT drives the innovative use of resources to promote new products, services, and ideas across the globe. The internet and the World Wide Web have transformed commerce, creating entirely new products and services, enhancing the way companies and their customers make transactions.

These advances in IT have spread quickly because they have progressively reduced the unit cost of computing power and transmissions. Smartphones and other handheld devices are preferred over personal computers.

In addition, the IT revolution is driving the extraordinarily rapid decrease in the cost and the rapid increase in the processing power of digital technologies. To keep up, technology firms seek skilled workers with not only knowledge of technology but also solid problem-solving abilities that give them an edge over the competition. Additionally, by dispersing offices globally, companies aim to recruit the best talent from different parts of the world. While technology accelerates globalization, globalization also accelerates developing technology.
