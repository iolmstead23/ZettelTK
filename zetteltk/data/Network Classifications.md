Other classifications of [[Networks|networks]] consider whether the networkâ€™s internal workings are based on designs that are in the public [[domain]] (open [[networks|network]]) or on designs owned or controlled by third parties (closed or proprietary [[networks]]). Open network designs are freely circulated and are often more popular than proprietary designs that are restricted by license fees and contracts. The internet is an example of an open [[networks|network]]. Communication over the internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the TCP/IP protocol. Anyone is free to use these [[Protocols|protocols]] without paying fees or signing license agreements. In contrast, an IT company might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing its system.
#### Bus

Yet another classification of [[networks]] considers the [[topology]] of the network or the pattern in which the machines are connected. Four common topologies are bus, star, ring, and mesh. Bus and star network topologies are the most common. In a bus network, the machines are connected to a common communication line called a bus.
#### Star

Star [[networks]] have a single machine serving as a central point to which all others are connected.
#### Ring

Ring topologies connect directly to each other as a peer.

The mesh network diagram looks much like the ring network diagram in that the computers appear to be arranged in a circle and connected to one another. However, their connections are drawn as straight lines rather than curved ones. In addition, their connections to non-adjacent computers in the network are drawn straight across, so that the connections inside the ring form a five pointed star.
#### Mesh

Mesh connects every device in a network to every other device; mesh [[networks]] enable redundancy while also introducing significantly more network traffic.

Alternatively, a network could use a hybrid of these topologies.

The bus [[topology]] became popular in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards/[[protocols]] known as the Ethernet. The star [[topology]] has roots as far back as the 1970s when it evolved from the idea of a large central [[computer]] system servicing many users at once. The star [[topology]] is used today in wireless [[networks]] where communication is carried out via radio broadcast to a central machine called the access point (AP).
