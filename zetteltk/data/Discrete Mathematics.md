Discrete [[Mathematics]] is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete (not continuous). It involves objects that can be counted, such as integers, graphs, and logical statements. Unlike [[calculus]] or real analysis, discrete [[mathematics]] deals with distinct and separate values, making it the foundation for fields like [[computer science]], cryptography, and [[combinatorics]].

1. **Logic and Propositions**
    
    - Studies the formalization of statements (propositions) and their truth values.
    - **Connections:** Forms the basis for proof techniques used in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].
2. **[[Set Theory]]**
    
    - Deals with the study of collections of objects (sets) and their properties.
    - **Connections:** Integral to [[topology]], [[algebra]], and [[probability]] theory.
3. **[[Graph Theory]]**
    
    - Studies graphs, consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
    - **Connections:** Related to network theory, algorithms, and [[optimization]] in operations research.
4. **[[Combinatorics]]**
    
    - Focuses on counting, arrangement, and combination of elements within a set.
    - **Connections:** Links to [[probability]], [[algebra]], and number theory.
5. **Number Theory**
    
    - Involves properties of integers and their relationships.
    - **Connections:** Basis for cryptography and algorithms.
6. **Algorithms and Complexity**
    
    - Study of procedures or rules (algorithms) for solving problems and the resources required (complexity).
    - **Connections:** Links to [[calculus]] for [[optimization]] and [[linear algebra]] for computational efficiency.
7. **[[Boolean Algebra]]**
    
    - Deals with binary variables and logical operations.
    - **Connections:** Foundation for digital electronics and circuit design.
8. **Discrete [[Probability]]**
    
    - Examines events in discrete sample spaces and probabilities associated with them.
    - **Connections:** Integral to [[statistics]] and stochastic processes.
9. **Theory of Computation**
    
    - Explores what can be computed and how efficiently it can be done.
    - **Connections:** Related to automata theory, algorithms, and [[Set Theory]].
