Complex numbers extend the [[real numbers]] by introducing the imaginary unit ii, where $i=−1​$. A complex number is written as $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are [[real numbers]]. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by $C$. In electrical engineering, complex numbers are used to analyze alternating current (AC) circuits, where impedance is represented as $Z=R+jX$. In quantum computing, the state of a qubit is described using complex numbers in $C2$. In control systems, the Laplace transform uses complex numbers ($s=σ+iω$) to solve differential equations. Complex numbers also play a key role in signal processing, where they represent phase shifts and frequencies in Fourier transforms.
