Todayâ€™s [[computer]] systems are the result of significant thought and technological developments spanning centuries. One of the earliest computing devices was the abacus, probably first used in China and then by the early Greek and Roman civilizations. The abacus consists of strings of beads strung on rods, which are mounted on a rectangular frame. As the beads are moved back and forth on the rod, their positions represent stored values. To carry out calculations, the abacus needs a human operator; otherwise, it is merely [[data]] storage. Thus, the abacus must be combined with a human to form a system whose purpose is carrying out additions.
