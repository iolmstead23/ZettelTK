[[Information]] is defined in terms of [[data]], [[information]], knowledge, and wisdom. The [[data]] pyramid is a concept that visualizes the [[data]]-[[information]]-knowledge-wisdom hierarchy.

_[[Information]]_ is a collection of processed [[data]] from a variety of sources. [[Data]] is continually aggregating and is not useful until it has been processed and is presented in a usable form. [[Data]] includes raw facts or observations.

Once [[data]] is organized, [[information]] can be inferred. Asking the questions why, who, what, where, and how allows us to use the [[data]] in a meaningful way and support decisions.

[[Information]] can be structured or unstructured, and the key term associated with it is meaning.

Knowledge is hard to define. A more frequently used definition is the following:

_Knowledge_ is a dynamic combination of experience, values, contextual [[information]], expert insight, and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and [[information]]. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In organizations, it often becomes embedded not only in documents and repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices, and norms.

The key term associated with knowledge is _context_.

_Wisdom_ is knowing the right thing to do.
