Implicit [[differentiation]] is a technique used in [[calculus]] to find the [[derivative]] of a [[function]] when the relationship between the variables $x$ and $y$ is given implicitly, rather than as an explicit [[function]] $y = f(x)$.

In implicit [[differentiation]]:

1. Both $x$ and $y$ are treated as variables.
2. The [[chain rule]] is applied to differentiate terms involving $y$, since $y$ is implicitly a [[function]] of $x$.

### **When to Use Implicit [[Differentiation]]**

- When it is difficult or impossible to solve for $y$ explicitly in terms of $x$.
- In equations involving products, quotients, or powers of $x$ and $y$.

### **Connection to [[Differentiation]] and [[Mathematics]]**

- **Extension of [[Differentiation]]**: Implicit [[differentiation]] broadens the scope of [[differentiation]] to include equations where variables are intertwined.
- **Applications**:
    - [[Geometry]]: Finding slopes of tangents to curves defined implicitly, like circles, ellipses, or hyperbolas.
    - Physics: Analyzing relationships between variables that cannot be explicitly expressed, such as in thermodynamics or mechanics.
    - Engineering: Used in systems modeling and [[optimization]] where variables depend on each other in complex ways.

### **Steps for Implicit [[Differentiation]]**

1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.
2. Apply the [[chain rule]] when differentiating terms involving $y$ (since $y=y(x)$).
    - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y \frac{dy}{dx}$​.
3. Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the [[derivative]].

### **Example Problem**

**Problem**: Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$​ if $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.

#### **Solution**:

1. **Differentiate both sides with respect to xxx:**
    
    $\frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + y^2] = \frac{d}{dx}[25].$
2. **Apply the [[derivative]] rules:**
    
    - [[Derivative]] of $x^2$ is $2x$.
    - [[Derivative]] of $y^2$ is $2y \frac{dy}{dx}$​ (using the [[chain rule]]).
    - [[Derivative]] of 25 is 0 (constant rule).
    
    The equation becomes:
    
    $2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.
3. **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$​:**
    
    - Subtract $2x$ from both sides: $2y \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x$.
    - Divide through by $2y$:$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$​.

### **Geometric Interpretation**

For the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, which represents a circle of radius 5, $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$​ gives the slope of the tangent line at any point $(x, y)$ on the circle.
### **Applications of Implicit [[Differentiation]]**

- **Tangent Lines**: Finding slopes of curves that are not functions (e.g., circles, ellipses).
- **Related Rates**: Solving problems where two or more quantities are changing with respect to time.
- **Engineering and Physics**: Analyzing systems with multiple dependent variables.
