Rational numbers, denoted by $Q$, are numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, $\frac {p}{q}$​, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q≠0$. Examples include 1221​, 0.750.75, and −3−3. Rational numbers are used in exact [[arithmetic]], such as in symbolic computation libraries like Python’s `fractions` module. In [[discrete mathematics]], rational numbers are essential for modular [[arithmetic]], where equations like $ax≡b \ (\ mod \ m)$ are solved. In [[data]] [[compression]], rational numbers encode ratios, such as the 16:9 aspect ratio for widescreen displays. Despite their simplicity, rational numbers are dense in the real number line, meaning between any two [[real numbers]], there exists a rational number.
