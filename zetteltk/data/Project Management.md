### Life Cycle Model

A project is a purpose-driven event that has a defined start and finish. [[Project Management|Project management]] frameworks ensure that projects are well defined, with clear, attainable goals, and that resources are in place for successful completion.
### Project Initiation

Project initiation broadly defines the project. It usually begins with a business case, followed by a feasibility study. During the feasibility study, research assesses whether the business case will lead to a reasonable, feasible solution. Project stakeholders provide input in the analysis of the business case, resulting in a project charter, or project initiation document, that outlines the business needs, the stakeholders, and the business case.
### Project Planning

Project planning includes developing a road map that everyone follows. This phase starts with setting the project goals, commonly using the SMART or CLEAR frameworks.

Project planning defines the _**project scope**_ and drafts a _**project management plan**_. The project management plan identifies project resources, including cost and time estimations. A project generally has each of the following documents by the end of the planning phase:

- scope statement outlining the objectives, deliverables, and milestones
- work breakdown structure (WBS) breaking the project into manageable segments for the team
- milestones defining high-level goals to meet throughout the project’s duration
- communication plan outlining the frequency and methods of communicating with stakeholders
- risk management plan identifying foreseeable risks, including cost overruns and delays
### Project Execution

During _**project execution**_, project deliverables are developed and completed. A kickoff meeting usually marks the start of this phase. Tasks typically include developing the project team, assigning resources, setting up tracking systems, conducting status meetings, and monitoring the project timetable.

Project performance is constantly observed during the execution phase. Key performance indicators, or metrics, are used to monitor the progress of the project, determining whether the project is on track to meet the defined milestones.
### Project Closure

At the _**project closure**_ phase, the project is declared complete and the project team is dissolved. Project managers complete the final project documentation, including financial reports. Generally, meetings are also a part of this phase, allowing members of the project team to reflect on strengths and opportunities for improvement.
