**[[Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727)** was a groundbreaking English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, widely recognized for his contributions to both [[Mathematics|mathematics]] and the natural sciences. His most notable work, *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687), laid the foundation for classical mechanics and introduced the laws of motion and universal gravitation. These laws explained how objects move and interact, forming the basis for much of modern physics.

In [[mathematics]], Newton developed [[Calculus|calculus]] independently around the same time as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], although they used different notations and approaches. Newton’s method of fluxions, as he called it, focused on the concept of changing quantities and their rates of change, which is central to [[Differentiation|differentiation]]. Leibniz, who introduced much of the notation we still use today (like the [[integral]] sign ∫ and d for differentials), also independently developed [[calculus]] around the same period.

The conflict over who invented [[calculus]] first led to a bitter dispute between Newton and Leibniz, each claiming credit for the discovery. Despite their rivalry, both made significant contributions that shaped the development of [[mathematics]]. Newton's work in [[mathematics]] and physics laid the groundwork for future scientific exploration, influencing countless fields, including engineering, astronomy, and economics. His legacy remains a cornerstone of modern scientific thought.
