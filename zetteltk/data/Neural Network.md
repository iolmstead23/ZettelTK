Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) designed to process and learn patterns in [[data]]. Neural networks are a key component of [[machine learning]] and are particularly effective in deep learning tasks. They are built using [[networks|network]] designs to store latent state [[data]].
### Brief History of Neural Networks

1. **Early Beginnings (1940s-1950s)**:  
   - The concept of artificial neurons was introduced by **Warren McCulloch** and **Walter Pitts** in 1943.  
   - **Frank Rosenblatt** developed the **Perceptron** in 1958, which was one of the first models capable of learning weights.

2. **Development Stagnation (1960s-1980s)**:  
   - Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert highlighted limitations in single-layer perceptrons, such as the inability to solve non-linear problems (e.g., XOR problem).  
   - Interest in neural networks waned until the development of **backpropagation** in the 1980s by **Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams**, which allowed multi-layer [[networks]] to learn efficiently.

3. **Modern Resurgence (1990s-Present)**:  
   - Advances in computational power, availability of [[data]], and [[optimization]] algorithms led to breakthroughs in deep learning.
   - Neural networks are now widely used in image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous systems, and more.
### Types of Neural Networks

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**:  
   - The simplest form of neural networks.  
   - Consists of **input**, **hidden**, and **output layers**.  
   - Used for general tasks like [[regression]] and classification.

   **Applications**:  
   - Predictive modeling (e.g., housing price prediction).  
   - Basic pattern recognition.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:  
   - Specialized for processing grid-like [[data]], such as images.  
   - Uses **convolutional layers** to extract spatial features and reduce [[dimensionality]] while retaining important [[information]].  
   - Incorporates **pooling layers** for down-sampling and **fully connected layers** for final predictions.

   **Applications**:  
   - Image recognition (e.g., facial recognition).  
   - Object detection (e.g., autonomous vehicles).  
   - Medical imaging (e.g., detecting tumors).

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:  
   - Designed for [[sequence]] [[data]], where context from previous inputs is important.  
   - Uses feedback loops to process sequential [[information]].  
   - Enhanced by architectures like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** to handle long-term dependencies.

   **Applications**:  
   - Natural language processing (e.g., machine translation).  
   - Time series analysis (e.g., stock market predictions).  
   - Speech recognition.

4. **Other Advanced Types**:  
   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Create new [[data]] by pitting two [[networks]] against each other (generator and discriminator).  
   - **Transformer Models**: Revolutionized NLP tasks by focusing on attention mechanisms instead of traditional recurrent designs.
### Structure of a Neural Network

1. **Input Layer**: Receives the [[data]] in numerical form.  
2. **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations through weighted connections and activation functions.  
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final result (classification or [[regression]]).
### Key Concepts in Neural Networks

- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions applied to the neurons (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).  
- **Backpropagation**: [[Algorithm]] for adjusting weights to minimize error.  
- **Training**: Involves optimizing weights using algorithms like **gradient descent**.
### Applications of Neural Networks

1. **Image and Video Analysis**: Facial recognition, self-driving cars.  
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis.  
3. **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, drug discovery.  
4. **Finance**: Fraud detection, stock market analysis.  
5. **Gaming and Simulation**: AI opponents, realistic graphics.
