Irrational numbers are [[real numbers]] that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, meaning they cannot be written in the form $\frac {q}{p}$​ where $p$ and $q$ are integers. Their decimal expansions are non-terminating and non-repeating. Famous examples include 22​, $\pi$, and $e$. In [[computer science]], irrational numbers are often approximated using algorithms, such as [[Monte Carlo]] Simulation methods for estimating $\pi$. In engineering, $\pi$ is used in signal processing for Fourier transforms and in [[geometry]] for calculating circumferences and areas. In chaos theory, constants like $e$ model exponential growth in dynamical systems. Despite their seemingly abstract nature, irrational numbers are crucial for understanding the continuity and complexity of the real world.
