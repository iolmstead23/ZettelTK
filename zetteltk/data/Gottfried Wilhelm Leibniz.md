**Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)** was a German mathematician, philosopher, and polymath known for his significant contributions to [[Mathematics|mathematics]], logic, and the sciences. He is most famous for developing [[Calculus|calculus]] independently of [[Isaac Newton]], although he introduced a different notation system that has become the standard in [[mathematics]] today.

Leibniz’s notation for [[calculus]] included the [[integral]] sign $\int$ and the differential notation $d$, which provides a clear and systematic way to express rates of change and areas under curves. His work laid the foundation for modern mathematical analysis and [[calculus]], emphasizing the importance of the infinitesimal and the concept of continuity.

In addition to [[calculus]], Leibniz made substantial contributions to philosophy, logic, and the development of mechanical calculators. He envisioned a universal language of science and [[mathematics]], which he referred to as a "characteristica universalis," a precursor to modern symbolic logic and [[computer]] science.

Leibniz’s relationship with [[Isaac Newton]] is marked by a contentious dispute over the invention of [[calculus]]. While both men developed the fundamental concepts of [[calculus]] independently, their differing approaches and notations led to a bitter rivalry. Newton's method, known as "fluxions," focused on the concept of motion, while Leibniz’s approach emphasized a more formal mathematical structure.

The conflict escalated into accusations of plagiarism, with both sides claiming precedence. This dispute not only affected their personal relationship but also had lasting implications for the history of [[mathematics]]. Despite the controversy, both men are credited as co-founders of [[calculus]], and their contributions have had an enduring impact on [[mathematics]] and science.
