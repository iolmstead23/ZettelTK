Quantifiers specify the scope of a proposition over a [[domain]] of discourse. They express whether statements about elements in a set are universally true or if there exists at least one element for which the statement is true. they are used in [[discrete mathematics]].

Quantifiers can be nested to express complex statements. For example:

- $\forall x \exists y, P(x, y)$: For every $x$, there exists a $y$ such that $P(x, y)$ is true.
- Truth depends on checking all $x$ for some matching $y$.
