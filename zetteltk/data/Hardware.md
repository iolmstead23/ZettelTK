[[Computer]] hardware encompasses all the physical components that make up a computing system. These components work together in a complex symphony, each playing a crucial role in processing, storing, and transmitting [[data]]. Understanding hardware requires both a broad overview of how components interact and detailed knowledge of individual parts' functions.

# Core Processing Unit (CPU)

The [[Central Processing Unit]] serves as the [[computer]]'s brain, executing instructions and performing calculations. Modern CPUs contain multiple cores and operate at frequencies measured in gigahertz (GHz). The CPU's operation can be understood through its fundamental cycle: fetch, decode, execute, and store. This process happens billions of times per second, with each cycle performing operations that can be represented [[mathematics|mathematically ]]as: $Frequency (Hz) = 1/Period (seconds)$.

# Memory Systems and Hierarchy

[[Computer]] memory operates in a hierarchical structure, balancing speed against capacity. At the fastest level, CPU registers provide immediate access to [[data]], followed by cache memory (L1, L2, L3), RAM, and finally, storage devices. This hierarchy follows a principle where access time increases as we move down the layers, represented by the relationship: $Access Time \propto Distance from CPU$. Cache hit rates, typically around 90-95%, significantly impact system performance.

# Storage Technologies

Modern storage systems range from traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) to Solid State Drives (SSDs) and emerging technologies like NVMe. The performance difference between these technologies can be substantial, with SSDs typically achieving [[data]] transfer rates of 500 MB/s to 7000 MB/s, while HDDs typically operate at 80-160 MB/s. The relationship between cost and performance follows approximately: $Cost per GB \propto Speed of Access$.

# Motherboard Architecture

The motherboard serves as the central nervous system, connecting all hardware components through various [[buses]] and interfaces. Modern motherboards use different bus speeds for different components, with PCIe lanes providing the highest bandwidth for graphics and storage. The total bandwidth available can be calculated using: $Bandwidth = Bus Width × Clock Speed × Transfers per Clock$.

# Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

GPUs handle visual [[data]] processing and increasingly support general-purpose computing tasks. Modern GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for parallel processing. Their performance in graphics applications is often measured in TFLOPS (trillion floating-point operations per second), calculated as: $TFLOPS = (GPU Cores × Clock Speed × Operations per Clock) / 10^{12}$.

# Power Supply and Thermal Management

Power supply units (PSUs) convert AC power to various DC voltages required by components. The power requirement can be estimated using: $Total Power = \sum Component Power + Overhead$. Thermal management is crucial, with CPU temperature typically maintained below 80°C through various cooling solutions. The heat dissipation follows: $Heat Dissipated = Power Consumed$.

# Input/Output Systems

I/O systems include various ports and interfaces that connect external devices. USB standards have evolved from USB 1.0 (12 Mbps) to USB 4 (40 Gbps). The theoretical maximum [[data]] transfer rate for any interface can be calculated using: $Max Transfer Rate = Signal Frequency × Bits per Symbol × Number of Channels$.

# Networking Hardware

Network interface cards (NICs) and wireless adapters handle [[data]] transmission across [[networks]]. Modern wireless standards like Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) can achieve theoretical speeds up to 9.6 Gbps, though real-world performance is typically lower due to various factors. Network throughput can be estimated using: $Actual Throughput = Theoretical Maximum × Efficiency Factor$.

# Hardware Security Features

Modern hardware includes various security features like Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), secure boot, and hardware [[encryption]]. These features provide a root of trust and secure key storage. The security level of [[encryption]] hardware can be related to key length: $Security Level \propto 2^{Key Length}$.

# Emerging Technologies

Quantum computing hardware represents a significant departure from classical computing, using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. The processing power of quantum computers scales exponentially with the number of qubits: $Processing Power \propto 2^n$, where n is the number of qubits.
