A **distributed [[Database|database]]** is a system in which the [[database]] is not confined to a single location; instead, [[data]] is spread across multiple machines or locations, typically connected via a [[networks|network]]. Each machine may store part of the [[database]], and users can access and manage the [[data]] as if it were a single [[database]]. 

This structure is highly advantageous for organizations with global or geographically distributed operations. For example, a multinational corporation may store employee records at local offices in different countries or regions but link those records together using a [[networks|network]] to create a single, distributed [[database]]. This allows for [[data]] redundancy, increased reliability, and better performance by distributing the load across multiple servers.

**Key benefits of Distributed Databases include**:
1. **[[Data]] locality**: [[Data]] can be stored closer to where it is used, reducing access times and improving performance.
2. **Scalability**: Distributed databases can scale horizontally by adding more machines rather than requiring a larger central server.
3. **Fault tolerance**: By replicating [[data]] across several nodes, a distributed [[database]] can tolerate [[hardware]] failures and keep functioning.
4. **Improved performance**: Since queries can be processed on multiple servers, distributed databases often outperform traditional centralized databases in large-scale systems.

In modern applications, **distributed databases** are common in large-scale systems such as cloud computing, social media platforms, and e-commerce applications. Technologies like **NoSQL databases**, **Apache Cassandra**, and **Google's Spanner** are examples of distributed [[database]] management systems (DDBMS) that are used to handle vast amounts of [[data]] across various locations efficiently.
