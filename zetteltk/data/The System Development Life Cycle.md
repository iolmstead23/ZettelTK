[[Computer]] system engineers use principles to guide the development of large, complex [[information]] systems. The development of these systems requires multiple employees over an extended period. It is also common for system and staffing requirements to change, adding more time to the project. While off-the-shelf products work for many tasks, they are not always a feasible solution. Unlike other fields of engineering, building [[information]] systems lack quantitative [[data]] for analysis, or metrics, for measuring the properties of the [[information]] systems.
### Case

Many methodologies used in the past have been replaced. Overcoming engineering issues related to [[computer]] systems, including the lack of metrics and prefabricated systems, leads to progress. Developing [[Software|software]] that can collect and analyze every aspect of the [[Software Development Life Cycle|software development life cycle]] (SDLC), led to the [[computer]]-aided [[software]] engineering (CASE) domain of [[software]] development:

- project planning, project scheduling, and personnel allocation
- documentation tools to assist in writing, organizing, and managing documents
- interface design tools to develop [[Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)]].
- programming tools to assist in writing and debugging code

Integrated development environments (IDEs) combine tools, such as editing, compiling, and debugging tools, into a single package. A few examples of IDEs that help users develop smartphone applications include Appery.io, TheAppBuilder, and AppMachine. Such programs provide the programming tools needed to write and debug the apps as well as a graphical display to simulate the application's interface and performance.

Organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) provide guidelines for developing integrated systems and establish standards for measuring the quality of system and [[software]] development.
