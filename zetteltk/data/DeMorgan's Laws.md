DeMorgan's Laws provide a way to transform logical expressions involving negation, conjunction (AND), and disjunction (OR). These laws are crucial in simplifying logical statements and are frequently used in digital logic design, [[Set Theory]], and [[computer science]]. It is a topic taught in [[discrete mathematics]].

The two laws are:

1. **¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q)**  
    (The negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.)
2. **¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)**  
    (The negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negations.)
#### Truth Tables:

##### Law 1: ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q)

|P|Q|P ∧ Q|¬(P ∧ Q)|¬P|¬Q|¬P ∨ ¬Q|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|T|T|T|F|F|F|F|
|T|F|F|T|F|T|T|
|F|T|F|T|T|F|T|
|F|F|F|T|T|T|T|

**Conclusion:**  
¬(P ∧ Q) produces the same truth values as (¬P ∨ ¬Q), proving the equivalence.

##### Law 2: ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)

|P|Q|P ∨ Q|¬(P ∨ Q)|¬P|¬Q|¬P ∧ ¬Q|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|T|T|T|F|F|F|F|
|T|F|T|F|F|T|F|
|F|T|T|F|T|F|F|
|F|F|F|T|T|T|T|

**Conclusion:**  
¬(P ∨ Q) produces the same truth values as (¬P ∧ ¬Q), proving the equivalence.
#### Applications:

1. **Simplification of Logical Statements:** DeMorgan's Laws help to reduce the complexity of logical expressions in algorithms and circuits.
2. **Digital Logic Design:** Used in designing and analyzing circuits such as NOT, AND, and OR gates.
3. **[[Set Theory]]:** The laws can be expressed as:
    - Complement of intersection: $(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C$
    - Complement of union: $(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C$
4. **Programming:** Helps in writing conditional statements that are equivalent but easier to understand or implement.
