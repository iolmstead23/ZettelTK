Imaginary numbers are multiples of the imaginary unit $i$, where $i=−1$​. They are a subset of [[complex numbers]] and are written in the form $bi$, where $b$ is a real number. While imaginary numbers alone do not represent quantities in the physical world, they are essential in complex analysis and engineering. In signal processing, imaginary numbers represent phase shifts in Fourier transforms. In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation involves ii in its formulation: $iℏ∂t∂ψ​=H^ψ$. In [[computer]] vision, imaginary numbers are used in edge detection algorithms, such as Fourier descriptors. Imaginary numbers, though abstract, provide a powerful tool for solving problems that cannot be addressed using only [[real numbers]].
