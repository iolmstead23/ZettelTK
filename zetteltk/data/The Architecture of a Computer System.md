### The [[Computer]] System

The [[computer]] system is a system of [[hardware]], [[Software|software]], [[networks|networking]], and human components that [[function]] together. The IPOS (input-process-ouput-storage) model explains what [[computer]] systems are used for. They take input, process it, and provide an output while using storage to keep intermediate and final results of the transformation of [[data]]. Individual [[hardware]] components support the [[function]] of [[computer]] systems.

### Basic Components

Generally, [[computer]] [[hardware]] contains three major components: the [[Central Processing Unit|central processing unit]], storage, and peripheral devices. The [[central processing unit]] supports [[data]] processing. [[Computer]] memory stores ephemeral programs and [[data]] in use temporarily for quick access and primarily store it in RAM. Peripheral devices support the input and output operations of the system. Most computing systems include these elements, which constitute the Von Neumann architecture of a [[computer]] system, another name for the IPOS model.
