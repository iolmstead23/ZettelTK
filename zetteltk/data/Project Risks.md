### Mitigating Project Risks

_**Risks in execution**_, _**risks in integration**_, and _**risks of the unknown**_ are three broad categories of risks a project may encounter. These risks need to be considered during project planning and monitored during project execution to minimize their effect on project completion.

Considering risks during the project planning phase includes several steps:

1. Identify the risks
2. Analyze their impact on the project outcome
3. Prioritize the risks by severity and likelihood
4. Outline a mitigation strategy to minimize potential risks
5. Install monitoring systems for anticipated and unanticipated risks

_**Risks in execution**_ typically revolve around budget, people, technology, equipment, and stakeholder support. Issues that can deem a project unsuccessful include cost overrun, insufficient staff, inadequate tools to support the project, and lack of support from project stakeholders. Planning in advance is one of the best ways to mitigate risks of execution.

The outcome of a project will likely affect other systems and processes in an organization. _**Risks of integration**_ can be mitigated by assessing potential disruptions, ensuring adequate support from stakeholders, and having a shared understanding of the project’s complexity.

Two key strategies to successfully identify risks are frequent monitoring of project parameters and milestones and sound communication between project participants.

Project risks take many forms and emerge for different reasons. Some of the most common examples of project risks are listed here:

- Scope creep—uncontrolled change of a project’s scope, typically adding tasks and increased, unplanned costs to the project
- Budget risk—budget control issues, such as underestimated or improper allocation of cost
- Resistance to change—departments and individuals resist organizational changes resulting from the project
- Resource risk—inability to secure sufficient resources for the project
- Contract risk—a vendor fails to deliver on contractual obligations
- Disputes or disagreements between project participants
- Project dependencies—especially when completion of some tasks is dependent on the completion of other tasks
- Project assumptions risk—when assumptions about the project are invalidated during project development
- Benefit shortfall—the project meets the requirements but delivers fewer benefits than outlined in the business case
- Requirements quality risk—requirements have not been properly validated or documented
- Force majeure risk—the chance of a major negative event beyond human control, such as a natural disaster
