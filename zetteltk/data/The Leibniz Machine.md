More sophisticated computing machines emerged between the Middle Ages and the Modern Era when a few inventors began to experiment with the technology of gears. These machines represented [[data]] through gear positioning. The [[data]] was initially entered by mechanically positioning the gears in a specific gear position. The final gear position represents the output of the calculations. One such machine is The Leibniz Machine in which the gears of the machine are initially mechanically set in a position that represents the input, and their final state represents the output of the calculations.

As the systems became more complex, they were able to perform more complex operations. The Leibniz machine was designed to perform basic [[arithmetic]] operations, and the [[Algorithm|algorithm]] for addition was embedded into the structure of the [[hardware]] itself. Babbage’s Analytical Engine (which was never constructed) was designed to read instructions in the form of holes on paper cards. In other words, Babbage’s Analytical Engine was programmable. Ada Lovelace, who published a paper demonstrating that the Analytical Engine is indeed programmable, is considered to be the world’s first programmer.
