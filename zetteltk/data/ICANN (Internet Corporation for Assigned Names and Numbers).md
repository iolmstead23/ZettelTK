The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating and overseeing several key aspects of the internet's infrastructure. Its primary functions include managing the domain name system (DNS), which involves allocating and overseeing [[domain names]] and IP addresses to ensure they are unique and globally accessible. ICANN also accredits domain name registrars, who are responsible for registering and managing [[domain names]] on behalf of individuals and organizations. Additionally, ICANN plays a crucial role in developing policies related to internet governance, ensuring the stability, security, and interoperability of the global internet. It operates under the supervision of multiple stakeholders, including governments, technical experts, businesses, and internet users, to promote an open and accessible internet for all.
