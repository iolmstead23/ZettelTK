### Memory/Mass Storage

The memory unit consists of _**random-access memory**_ (RAM), sometimes referred to as primary or main memory. Unlike a hard drive (permanent memory, secondary memory), this memory is fast and directly accessible by the CPU. Loading [[data]] from secondary to primary memory allows the CPU to operate faster. However, RAM is ephemeral, meaning [[data]] stored in RAM is lost when the [[computer]] is powered off.

RAM is split into partitions. Each partition consists of an address and its contents, all in binary form. The address uniquely identifies every location in the memory.

In addition to RAM, read-only memory (ROM) is another component that stores instructions for crucial system activities, including booting up the system and initializing different [[computer]] components.

### Peripheral Devices

Various units that support the input and output functions are collectively called _**peripheral devices**_ and comprise the I/O unit. _**Input**_ devices, such as keyboards, mouses, and sensors, are used to move [[data]] into computers. _**Output**_ devices, such as printers and monitors, are used to move [[information]] out of computers.
