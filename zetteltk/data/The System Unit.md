The System Unit, also known as a tower or chassis, encases various components already mentioned: the motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, and any other internally installed components. The term system unit is often used to differentiate between the [[computer]] and its peripheral devices.
### Components of the System Unit

#### **The Motherboard**

Again, the motherboard is the main circuit board for the [[computer]] containing both soldered components that cannot be removed and sockets or slots for components that can be removed. The motherboard holds the CPU, RAM, and ROM chips, as well as other [[hardware]] components. RAM stores instructions and [[data]] while they are being used. This storage is volatile, which means when the system is turned off, the contents in RAM are lost. Unlike RAM, ROM chips are nonvolatile memory, keeping their content whether the system is on or off, and generally contain instructions for starting up the [[computer]].

#### **[[Computer]] Processing Unit (CPU)**

You have already learned that the CPU is the brain of the [[computer]]. It executes instructions and tells other components what to do.

#### **The System Clock**

The system clock sends out a pulse of electricity at regular intervals. The electronic components of the [[computer]] need these electric pulses in order to operate. The more pulses sent out by the system clock, the faster the [[computer]]. One instruction gets processed per pulse. Multiple processing units and a higher clock speed increase the processing speed of the [[computer]] system. The system speed commonly is measured in two primary measurements:

- megahertz (MHz), which converts to millions of pulses per second
- gigahertz (GHz), which converts to billions of pulses per second

#### **Expansion Slots**

Expansion slots are sockets on the motherboard where expansion cards can be installed. Common types of expansion cards include graphics, sound, and [[networks|network]] cards.

#### **Ports**

Ports are sockets that allow cables to be plugged in without opening the system unit. Some examples are serial, parallel, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, which are recognizable by their distinct shapes.
