The **Power Rule** is a quick method for finding the [[Derivative|derivative]] of functions in the form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is any real number. The rule states that for $f(x) = x^n$, the [[Derivative|derivative]] $f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}$. In other words, multiply by the exponent, then reduce the exponent by one. For example, the [[derivative]] of $x^3$ is $3x^2$.

In **[[Algebra]]**, the [[Power Rule]] primarily deals with simplifying expressions by applying exponent rules, which helps prepare for [[Differentiation|differentiation]] in [[Calculus|calculus]].

In **[[Calculus]]**, the Power Rule is foundational in **differential [[calculus]]**, enabling quick calculations of derivatives in [[polynomial]] functions and laying groundwork for more complex rules (e.g., Product, Quotient, Chain Rules). Early mathematicians like **[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]** and **[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]** contributed to the formalization of [[calculus]] in the 17th century, and the [[power rule|Power Rule ]]became an essential shortcut within their broader work on rates of change.

This rule is widely applied in physics, engineering, and economics to solve rate problems and optimize processes, making it a key concept for those fields.
