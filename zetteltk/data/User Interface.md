The user interface allows end users to communicate with the [[Operating System]]. [[Command-line interface]] (CLIs) are a type of user interface that communicate with end users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor.

Contemporary operating systems have [[Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)]]. GUIs allow end users to issue commands through input devices such as mouses, keyboards, or touch screens. On a touch screen, a user can directly manipulate icons with their finger or a stylus.

While the user interface is an important part of a machine’s functionality, it is only the intermediary between the end user and the [[operating system]]. The distinction between the user interface and the internal parts of the [[operating system]] is emphasized by the fact that some operating systems require the user to select an available interface according to their preferences.
