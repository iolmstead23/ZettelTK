### Technology and Ethics

Questions about the impact of [[information]] technology are widespread and ever-present. With the release of new technologies and applications, more questions arise than we can answer or agree on.

- Does [[information]] technology make society better or worse?
- Is it acceptable to participate in a technical society without making an effort to understand [[information]] technology?
- Do people who determine how technology will be supported or used have an obligation to understand technology?
- To what extent should governments regulate [[information]] technology?
- How do our decisions regarding technology affect future generations?
- How should we change education to align with our ever-evolving technological society?
- How can knowledge of an individual's activities tracked through technology be appropriately used while simultaneously ensuring it is not abused?

Consider having a discussion with a friend or colleague about one or more of these questions. Do you and your colleague agree? What other questions emerged from your discussion?
### Legal, Ethical, and Regulatory Issues in the Computing Disciplines

Everyday computing has evolved rapidly, leading to both regulatory and social changes. Many computing laws are based on previous mindsets and physical considerations. Such laws fail to take into consideration the unique features of computing. For example, [[data]] has three primary stages: [[data]] at rest, [[data]] in transit, and [[data]] in use. When a crime occurs involving [[data]], which country has the right to press charges—where the [[data]] was temporarily stored ([[data]] in use), where the server is located ([[data]] at rest), or the many locations the [[data]] passed through ([[data]] in transit)?

Advances in computing also affect ethics, challenging the traditional principles on which social behaviors are based. For example, do new applications represent new freedoms or new controls?

The difference between ethics and regulations is important when considering everyday computing. Regulations are requirements set by governing bodies and can result in penalties, fines, or even criminal charges. Alternatively, ethics are the morals that individuals and organizations abide by. For example, the ethics a person lives by determine whether that person takes lost money to its owner or puts it in their pocket. On the other hand, stealing money from a person’s pocket is illegal, or against the regulations, rather than against a person’s ethics.

Computing professionals and organizations must continuously consider their ethical and regulatory obligations; security, ownership, and liability; and social impact.
### Ethics and [[Information]] Technology

Philosophers have taken many different approaches to ethics in their search for fundamental theories and principles to guide decisions and behaviors. Character-based ethics (also known as virtue ethics) argues that good behavior is not the result of applying identifiable rules (regulations), but is instead a natural consequence of good character. Other theories of ethics, such as consequence-based, duty-based, and contract-based, suggest that ethical dilemmas are resolved by considering consequences, duties, and contracts.

Character-based ethics is usually what is presented and discussed with professionals. Rather than reviewing specific ethical theories, they review case studies leading to a variety of ethical questions related to the professional's area of expertise. Discussing these case studies helps professionals become more aware of ethical issues.

Reflect on an ethical dilemma you faced while using technology. What did you consider to arrive at your conclusion?
