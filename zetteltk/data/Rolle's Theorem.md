Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the [[Mean Value Theorem]], applicable when a [[function]] meets certain conditions. It states that if a [[function]] $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ differentiable on the open interval $[a,b]$, and if $f(a)=f(b)$, then there exists at least one value $c$ in the interval $[a,b)$ where the [[Derivative|derivative]] $f′(c)=0$. This means there is a point $c$ where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal.

### Key Assumptions:

1. **Continuity** on $[a,b]$: The [[function]] $f(x)$ must be continuous on the closed interval from $a$ to $b$, ensuring no gaps, jumps, or vertical asymptotes.
2. **Differentiability** on $[a,b]$: The [[function]] must be differentiable on the open interval, ensuring a well-defined slope everywhere between $a$ and $b$.
3. **Equal Values at the Endpoints**: The condition $f(a)=f(b)$ ensures that the curve starts and ends at the same height, implying that there must be at least one point in between with a horizontal tangent.

### Visualization:

Because $f(a)=f(b)$, the curve has to "turn around" between $a$ and $b$ if it is continuous and smooth, creating a peak or a valley. At this peak or valley, the slope is zero, so there exists a point $c$ where $f′(c)=0$, which means the tangent at $c$ is parallel to the x-axis.

Rolle’s Theorem is foundational for understanding more complex theorems in [[Calculus|calculus]], such as the [[Mean Value Theorem]] and Taylor's Theorem.
