Calculus is the [[mathematics|mathematical ]]study of continuous change, and it encompasses two main areas: **differential calculus** and **[[integral]] calculus**. Differential calculus is concerned with finding the rate at which things change (derivatives), while [[integral]] calculus focuses on accumulation and area under curves (integration). Both are essential tools in fields such as physics, engineering, and economics.

**Brief History**  
Calculus as we know it was independently developed in the 17th century by **[[Isaac Newton]]** and **[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]**. Newton used calculus to describe motion and change in physics, particularly for his laws of motion and gravitation. Leibniz, meanwhile, developed much of the notation that we still use today. The dispute over who “invented” calculus led to a famous rivalry, but both are now credited for their work, which revolutionized [[mathematics]] and the sciences.

**Limits**
The concept of a **limit** is fundamental to calculus, as it formalizes the idea of approaching a certain value. In notation, the limit as $x$ approaches a value $c$ is written as $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$. Limits allow us to rigorously define derivatives and integrals by describing how functions behave as inputs approach specific points. For example, the limit enables the calculation of instantaneous velocity by considering an object’s position over an infinitely small time interval.

**Derivatives and [[Differentiation]]**  
A **[[derivative]]** represents the instantaneous rate of change of a [[function]]. For a [[function]] $f(x)$, the [[derivative]], written as $f'(x)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}$, is found by computing $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$. This calculation provides a [[function]]’s slope at any point, allowing us to determine how quickly or slowly values change. [[Differentiation]] is the process of finding a [[derivative]], and it’s widely used in applications requiring rate of change analysis. Examples include calculating velocity in physics, optimizing functions in economics, and modeling growth rates in biology.

Key rules for [[differentiation]] include the **[[Power Rule]]**, **[[Product Rule]]**, **[[Quotient Rule]]**, and **[[Chain Rule]]**, which simplify finding derivatives for various types of functions. [[Differentiation]] enables the solving of problems involving [[optimization]], such as maximizing profit or minimizing costs, by setting the [[derivative]] equal to zero to find critical points.

**Integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**  
**Integration** is the reverse process of [[differentiation]] and deals with summing infinitely small quantities to find accumulations, such as area under a curve. For a continuous [[function]] $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$, the definite [[integral]] is written as $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx$. Integration allows for the calculation of areas, volumes, and other quantities that accumulate over an interval.

The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** links [[differentiation]] and integration, stating that if $F(x)$ is the [[antiderivative]] of $f(x)$, then $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx = F(b) - F(a)$. This theorem shows that [[differentiation]] and integration are inverse processes and provides a practical way to evaluate integrals using antiderivatives.

**Applications of [[Differentiation]] and Integration**  
[[Differentiation]] and integration have vast applications. **[[Differentiation]]** is used for optimizing functions, modeling rates of change, and analyzing behavior in fields like physics, biology, and finance. **Integration**, on the other hand, is critical for solving problems involving accumulation, such as computing total distance traveled from velocity or determining the area under complex curves.

Together, these concepts form the core of calculus, offering powerful tools to analyze and understand changes and quantities across various disciplines.
