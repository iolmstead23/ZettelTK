Secondary storage devices hold [[data]] and [[information]] permanently. Secondary storage devices store [[data]] and instructions while they are not being used; the saved content remains on the secondary storage unit even when the [[computer]] is powered down. There is a variety of secondary storage types, including floppy and hard drives, flash drives, magnetic tape, and optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs.

A bit is the smallest unit of storage that is set to 0 or to 1. Bits need to be combined to create a useful representation of [[data]] or [[information]]; a group of eight bits forms a byte. A byte contains enough [[information]] to store a single character, such as the letter “M.”
### [[Computer]] Storage and Memory

[[Computer]] storage and memory are often measured in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB). A medium-sized novel contains about 1 MB of [[information]]. 1 MB is 1,024 kilobytes, or 1,048,576 (1024x1024) bytes, not one million bytes. However, you may find documents that estimate each MB to 1,000 KB. When planning storage requirements, be sure to verify the accuracy of the documented storage capacity. Similarly, 1 gigabyte (GB) is 1,024 MB, 1 terabyte (TB) is 1,024 GB, and 1 petabyte (PB) is 1,024 TB. For another point of reference, 1 TB is roughly equivalent to 1,500 CDs worth of [[data]], and 1 PB of [[data]] would create over 1.5 million CDs, a stack a mile high.
