Application [[software]] consists of the programs that perform tasks specific to the machine’s general purpose. A [[computer]] used to maintain a store’s inventory needs different [[software]] than a machine used by a mechanical engineer. Spreadsheet, [[database]], [[desktop]] publishing, accounting, and program development [[software]] are all examples of application [[software]]. Those who are not in the IT field might refer to application [[software]] as productivity or collaboration [[software]] or tools.
