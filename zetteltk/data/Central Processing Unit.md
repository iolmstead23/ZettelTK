The **[[Central Processing Unit|central processing unit]] (CPU)** is the electronic circuit responsible for executing [[computer]] program instructions. The CPU consists of three parts: 

1. the [[arithmetic]] logic unit (ALU), which contains circuitry that performs operations on [[data]] (such as addition and subtraction); 
2. the control unit, which contains the circuitry coordinating the machine’s activities; and 
3. the processor register, which contains [[data]] storage cells called registers.

Registers are high-speed storage areas in the CPU. All [[data]] must be stored in a register before it can be processed. They serve as temporary holding places for [[data]] being manipulated by the CPU. Registers hold the inputs to the ALU and store the results. To perform an operation on [[data]] stored in the main memory, the control unit

- **transfers** the [[data]] from the main memory into the registers,
- **informs** the ALU which registers hold the [[data]],
- **activates** the ALU, and
- **tells** the ALU which register should receive the result.
