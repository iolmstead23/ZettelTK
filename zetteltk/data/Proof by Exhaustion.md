## Definition

Proof by exhaustion is a [[mathematics|mathematical ]]technique used to prove a statement is true for all possible cases by systematically checking each individual case.

## Key Characteristics

- Used for finite sets of possibilities
- Requires examining every possible scenario
- Guarantees truth by covering all potential instances

## Steps of Proof by Exhaustion

1. **Identify the Finite Set of Cases**
    - Clearly define all possible scenarios or instances
    - Ensure no cases are missed
2. **Check Each Case Individually**
    - Prove the statement holds true for every single case
    - Methodical and systematic verification
3. **Conclude Universal Truth**
    - If the statement is true for ALL cases, the proof is complete

## Example Scenario

Consider proving: "For integers x between 1 and 5, x² is always positive"

Cases to check:

- x = 1: 1² = 1 ✓
- x = 2: 2² = 4 ✓
- x = 3: 3² = 9 ✓
- x = 4: 4² = 16 ✓
- x = 5: 5² = 25 ✓

## Limitations

- Only works for finite, enumerable sets
- Becomes impractical with large numbers of cases
- Different from mathematical induction, which proves infinite sequences

## Practical Applications

- [[Discrete mathematics]]
- [[Computer science]] algorithms
- Number theory [[proofs]]
- Combinatorial problems

## Best Practices

- Be systematic
- Document each case clearly
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
- Use clear logical reasoning
