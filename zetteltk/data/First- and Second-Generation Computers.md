### Vacuum Tubes (1946–1959)

ENIAC emerged in 1946 as a 30-ton machine with 18,000 vacuum tubes. When it was first being used, lights dimmed in sections of Philadelphia.

The first-generation computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and they were often enormous in size. They consumed a great deal of electricity and were expensive to operate. They often malfunctioned because of the excessive heat they generated.

This generation of computers relied on machine languages, the lowest-level programming languages understood by computers. They could run one program at a time and it took a long time, sometimes weeks, to set up a different program. Punched cards were used for input, and the computers printed out the outputs. EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer), UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer), IBM-701, and IBM-650 are other notable first-generation computers.

Vacuum tubes were the only electronic components available during the first generation of computers and could complete calculations within milliseconds. However, vacuum tubes were large, had limited storage capacity, were unreliable, and required a lot of maintenance.
### Transistors (1959–1965)

Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the second generation of computers. Transistors were more reliable and economical. The smaller electronic components in the second generation could maintain two states, “Off” and “On,” represented by the binary digits 0 and 1, respectively. Although transistors were invented in 1947, it took almost a decade for them to find their place in [[computer]] [[hardware]].

Second-generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output. Tapes and disks were used for storage purposes. The first computers of this generation were built for the atomic energy industry and included Honeywell 400, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and UNIVAC 1108.

Over 100 [[computer]] programming languages were developed to work with second-generation computers. Machine languages representing instructions in binary (0s and 1s) were replaced by assembly languages that specified instructions using words. High-level programming languages were also developed, such as early versions of [[FORTRAN]] (FORmula TRANslation) and [[COBOL]] (Common Business-Oriented Language).

While these computers were smaller in size, used less energy, and were easier to move, they were used for specific purposes and still required cooling systems and constant maintenance.
