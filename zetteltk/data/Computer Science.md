[[Computer]] science heavily relies on [[mathematics]] and logic as foundational tools to analyze, design, and implement computational systems. [[Mathematics]] provides the formal language and frameworks for describing algorithms, [[data]] structures, and computational processes. For instance, discrete [[mathematics]] is essential for understanding logic, [[Set Theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[graph theory]], all of which underpin algorithms and [[database]] structures. [[Calculus]] and [[linear algebra]] play a critical role in fields like [[computer]] graphics, [[machine learning]], and [[optimization]] problems, while [[probability]] and [[statistics]] are crucial for [[data]] science, artificial intelligence, and [[networks|network]] analysis. Logic, a cornerstone of [[mathematics]], is central to [[computer]] science through Boolean [[algebra]], predicate logic, and formal methods, which are used to design circuits, verify algorithms, and ensure [[software]] correctness. The overlap between the two disciplines is profound, as both seek to create precise, reliable models of systems, whether they are physical, abstract, or computational, enabling innovation in technology and solving complex problems systematically.
