_A [[networks|network]] is a collection of two or more connected devices that can communicate with one another. Before we talk about the [[hardware]] that processes messages on a [[networks|network]] , let’s start with the lowest level of components in a network: the transmission media. A transmission medium (the singular form of the word “media”) is simply a component that carries [[data]] from one network device to another. There are two types of transmission media: wired and wireless._
### Transmission Media

[[Data]] travels through a [[networks|network]] using communication channels that connect the network components. Both wired and wireless [[Networks|networks]] require network media to transfer [[data]]. Twisted pair cables, [[Coaxial Cable|coaxial cable]], and optical fiber cables are common [[networks|network]] media used in wired [[networks]], while wireless [[networks]] use radio waves, microwaves, and infrared waves.

Twisted pair cables are the most widely used type of transmission media. Two common types of twisted pair cables are unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). STP cables consist of two separately insulated copper wires wound around each other, making them more expensive than UTP cables. The insulating sheath on STP cables protects the wires from things like neighboring unshielded cables and electromagnetic interference from fluorescent lights. Twisted pair cables come in various bandwidth capacities with a maximum segment length of 100 meters (328 feet). Common types of ethernet cords are [[Cat5e]],  [[Cat6]], and [[Fiber Optic]].
### Network Bandwidth

Network bandwidth is typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and gigabits (Gbps) per second. (Note the distinction between Mbps and MB. One megabit is equivalent to 1,000 kilobits, whereas one megabyte is equivalent to 1,024 kilobytes.)
### Coaxial Cables

Coaxial cables (often referred to as "coax") have an outer plastic that is used in [[computer]] [[networks]] and to deliver cable TV services. First used commercially used in the 1940s, it is used for both baseband and broadband [[data]] communication services. The bandwidth of coaxial cables is about 80 times the bandwidth of twisted wires. Cable modems and televisions typically use coaxial cables.

Baseband is a signal at a very narrow frequency range on which [[data]] or [[information]] is superimposed and then transmitted. Examples include Ethernet LANs and serial cables.

Broadband is considered high-capacity transmission technologies that are used to transmit [[data]], voice, and video across long distances and at high speeds. Examples include [[coaxial cable]], fiber optic cable, and radio waves.

### Fiber-Optic Cable

Fiber-optic cable uses the concept of reflection of light through a core made up of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding. Fiber-optic cable are able to transmit large volumes of [[data]]. Their bandwidth can provide up to 26,000 times the bandwidth of the twisted pair wires, at the time of this writing.
### Wireless Transmission

The use of wireless transmission media is sometimes more convenient and practical than installing cables. Electromagnetic waves of different frequencies, such as infrared or radio waves, can be used to transmit [[data]] within a network with the use of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or even near field communication. These radio waves are what is used to carry radio signals far distances to other networked devices.

Many believe Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity. However, it is just a play on words according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and it was created by a marketing team. Wi-Fi adapters are commonly installed on mobile [[computer]] devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Wi-Fi adapters enable devices to connect to each other or to the internet. Each of these wireless transmission methods has its own [[Protocols|protocols]] to identify how to connect and transmit or receive [[data]]. Each uses different frequencies, which makes it possible for [[data]] to travel over small and large distances. These wireless technologies are examples of wireless media that can exchange [[data]], such as sending audio to a Bluetooth speaker, sending files from one PC to another, or making a payment with your smartphone at the grocery store through near field communication (NFC). Bluetooth supports distances shorter than 30 feet, while Wi-Fi devices can be accessed up to 300 feet away.
