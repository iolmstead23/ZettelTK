The quadratic formula is a vital [[mathematics|mathematical ]]tool with applications across physics, engineering, and beyond. Its universal nature allows it to solve any quadratic equation efficiently, and its relationship with [[calculus]] ensures it remains relevant in [[optimization]] problems and curve analysis.

The quadratic formula was derived through the process of _completing the square_. The method dates back to ancient Babylonian mathematicians (circa 2000 BCE) and was formalized in its modern form by European mathematicians during the Renaissance. It is a cornerstone of [[algebra]] and [[calculus]] because it bridges algebraic equations with geometric and real-world applications.

The quadratic formula is a mathematical tool used to find the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation takes the general form:
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

Here, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$. The formula provides an exact solution for $x$, regardless of whether the roots are real or complex. It is written as:$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
This formula solves the equation by using the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ directly, making it universally applicable to all quadratics.

### **Quadratic Equations in Standard Form**

Standard form is critical because it organizes the equation as $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. This format:

- Ensures that coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ are easy to identify for substitution into the quadratic formula.
- Simplifies [[differentiation]] when analyzing rates of change or slopes. Differentiating $ax^2 + bx + c$ gives:$$\frac {dx}d​(ax^2+bx+c)=2ax+b$$
This [[derivative]] determines the slope of the quadratic curve at any point. It is particularly useful for finding the [[vertex]] or optimizing parabolic models.
### **Why the Discriminant Matters**

The discriminant, $b^2 - 4a$, is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root. It determines the nature of the roots:

- $b^2 - 4ac > 0$: Two distinct real roots.
- $b^2 - 4ac = 0$: One real root (a repeated root).
- $b^2 - 4ac < 0$: Two complex roots.
### **Example**

Solve $2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:  
Here, $a=2, b=−4$, and $c=−6$.

$$x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}$$
$$x=\frac {4±\sqrt{16+48}​​}4$$
$$x=\frac {4±\sqrt 64​​}{4}$$
$$x=\frac {4±8}{4}​$$
The roots are $x=3$ and $x=−1$.
