Differentiation is a fundamental concept in [[Calculus]] that deals with measuring how a [[function]] changes as its input changes. The [[Derivative]] of a [[function]] represents the rate of change or the slope of the [[function]] at a particular point. In simpler terms, differentiation helps us understand how a quantity varies in response to changes in another related quantity.
#### Key Concepts

1. **[[Derivative]]**: The [[derivative]] of a [[function]] $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is written as $f'(x)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}$. It gives the rate of change of $f(x)$ as $x$ changes.

2. **Geometrical Interpretation**: The [[Derivative]] represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the [[function]] at any given point. A positive [[derivative]] means the [[function]] is increasing, while a negative [[derivative]] means the [[function]] is decreasing.

3. **Rules of Differentiation**:
   - **[[Power Rule]]**: For $f(x) = x^n$, the [[derivative]] is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.
   - **[[Product Rule]]**: For $f(x) = u(x) \cdot v(x)$, the [[derivative]] is $f'(x) = u'(x) \cdot v(x) + u(x) \cdot v'(x)$.
   - **[[Quotient Rule]]**: For $f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, the [[derivative]] is 
    $$
     f'(x) = \frac{u'(x) \cdot v(x) - u(x) \cdot v'(x)}{v(x)^2}.
     $$
   - **[[Chain Rule]]**: For a composition of functions $f(x) = g(h(x))$, the [[derivative]] is 
     $$
     f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x).
     $$

4. **Higher-Order Derivatives**: The second [[derivative]] $f''(x)$ gives [[information]] about the curvature of the [[function]], and higher derivatives provide further insights into the behavior of the [[function]].
#### Applications

- **Physics**: Derivatives are used to compute velocity, acceleration, and other rates of change in physics.
- **Economics**: Marginal cost and marginal revenue are calculated using derivatives.
- **Engineering**: Derivatives are crucial for [[optimization]] problems, such as maximizing efficiency or minimizing cost.
- **[[Computer]] Science**: In [[machine learning]], derivatives are used in gradient descent algorithms to minimize error functions.

Differentiation is a powerful tool in [[Mathematics|mathematics]] for analyzing dynamic systems and understanding the behavior of various functions.
