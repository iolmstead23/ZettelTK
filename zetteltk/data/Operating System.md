### Types of operating systems

Operating systems typically come in four categories: [[networks|network]] operating systems, server operating systems, mobile operating systems, or personal [[computer]] operating systems. Many types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features.

Operating systems typically fall into one of two categories: [[networks|network]] [[Operating System|operating system]] or [[Desktop|desktop]] operating system. Many types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features. Three of the most common operating systems are [[Windows]], [[MacOS]], and [[Linux]].

**Operating Systems for mobile devices**

Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, run operating systems designed specifically for the device.  Examples include [[Google Android]] and [[Apple iOS]].

### Operating Systems Users

An operating system is also tasked with protecting the [[computer]]’s resources from unauthorized users. When a [[computer]] is used by multiple people, each user is assigned their own account on the [[computer]]. A user account is a record within the operating system with [[information]] such as a name, password, and user privileges (e.g., administrator vs. standard user). The operating system uses this [[information]] during each log-in to control access to the system and resources.

Accounts are established by the administrator, whose account is often called a superuser or root account. When the end user supplies the proper credentials during the log-in procedure, the user is given access to the operating system. Administrators can alter settings, modify critical [[Software|software]] packages, and perform other maintenance activities denied to other users.
