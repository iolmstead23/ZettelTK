The [[Kernel|kernel]] of an [[Operating System|operating system]] stores a collection of [[Device Drivers|device drivers]], [[Software|software]] that communicates with controllers or other peripheral devices. Device drivers translate generic requests into the technical steps required to complete the task. Device drivers, sometimes referred to as middleware, facilitate the communication of [[hardware]] and [[software]]. A print driver needs to be installed if a user wants to send a document to the printer. A Bluetooth headphone driver is necessary if a user wants to listen to music on Bluetooth headphones. Some device drivers are installed automatically, while others would need to be downloaded and installed from the manufacturers' sites.
