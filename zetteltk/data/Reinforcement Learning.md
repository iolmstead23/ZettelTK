Reinforcement Learning (RL) represents a paradigm in [[machine learning]] where agents learn optimal behaviors through interactions with an environment. Unlike [[supervised learning]], which requires labeled training [[data]], or unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled [[data]], RL enables agents to learn from experience through trial and error. This approach mirrors how humans and animals naturally learn, making it particularly suitable for complex decision-making tasks.

## Fundamental Concepts

The RL framework consists of key elements that form its mathematical foundation. An agent interacts with an environment over discrete time steps. At each step, the agent observes the current state, takes an action, receives a reward, and transitions to a new state. This interaction creates a feedback loop that drives the learning process. The mathematical formulation involves several crucial components:

$S$: The state space representing all possible situations $A$: The action space containing all possible actions $R$: The reward [[function]] defining immediate feedback $P$: The transition [[probability]] [[function]] describing environment dynamics $\gamma$: The discount factor balancing immediate and future rewards

## Markov Decision Processes

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide the theoretical framework for RL. The Markov property states that the future depends only on the present state, not the history of how we arrived there. Formally, an MDP is defined as a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$. The goal is to find a policy $\pi$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward:

$V^\pi(s) = E_\pi[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_{t+1} | S_0 = s]$

## Value-Based Methods

Value-based methods estimate the value of being in a state or taking an action in a state. The Q-learning [[algorithm]] represents a fundamental approach in this category. It learns an action-value [[function]] $Q(s,a)$ that estimates the expected return starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and following the optimal policy thereafter. The Q-learning update rule is:

$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$

## Policy-Based Methods

Policy-based methods directly learn the optimal policy without maintaining a value [[function]]. These methods work well for continuous action spaces and can learn stochastic policies. The policy gradient theorem provides the foundation for many algorithms in this category. The basic update rule follows the gradient:

$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = E_{\pi_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^{\pi_\theta}(s,a)]$

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep RL combines [[neural network|neural networks]] with RL principles to handle high-dimensional state spaces. Deep Q-Network (DQN) represents a breakthrough in this field, introducing several innovations:

- Experience replay buffer to store and reuse past experiences
- Target network to stabilize training
- Convolutional [[neural network|neural networks]] to process visual input

The [[loss function]] for DQN training is:

$L(\theta) = E[(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a';\theta^-) - Q(s,a;\theta))^2]$

## Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic methods combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based approaches. The actor learns the policy while the critic evaluates the actor's actions through value estimation. These methods often demonstrate improved stability and sample efficiency. The advantage actor-critic (A2C) update follows:

$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) A(s,a)$

where $A(s,a)$ represents the advantage [[function]].

## Exploration vs. Exploitation

The exploration-exploitation dilemma represents a fundamental challenge in RL. Agents must balance exploring new actions to discover potentially better strategies with exploiting known good actions to maximize rewards. Common approaches include:

$\epsilon$-greedy: Choose random action with [[probability]] $\epsilon$ Softmax: Select actions probabilistically based on their estimated values Upper Confidence Bound: Add exploration bonus to value estimates
