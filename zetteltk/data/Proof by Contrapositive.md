## Definition

A proof by contrapositive proves a statement by demonstrating its logical equivalent: "If not Q, then not P". It is a special case of [[Proof by Contradiction]].

## Logical Structure

- Original statement: P → Q
- Contrapositive: (¬Q) → (¬P)
- Logically equivalent statements

## Key Steps

1. Assume the negation of the conclusion
2. Use logical reasoning
3. Reach a contradiction or prove the original hypothesis false

## Example

**Prove: If x is an integer and x² is even, then x is even**

Contrapositive Proof:

- Assume x is odd
- x = 2k + 1 for some integer k
- x² = (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1
- x² = 2(2k² + 2k) + 1
- x² is odd
- Contradiction: x² was assumed even
- Therefore, original statement is true

## Advantages

- Useful when [[direct proof]] is difficult
- Alternative approach to complex implications
- Logically equivalent to [[direct proof]]

## When to Use

- Complex conditional statements
- Difficult [[direct proof|direct proofs]]
- Statements involving implications

## Limitations

- Requires careful logical reasoning
- Must maintain logical equivalence
