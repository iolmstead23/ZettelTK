The [[software]] development life cycle (SDLC) typically consists of the following six steps:

1. Requirements Gathering: In this initial phase, stakeholders identify and document the project's requirements, including functional, non-functional, and technical specifications. This involves gathering input from end-users, clients, and other stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
2. Analysis and Design: Once the requirements are gathered, the development team analyzes them to determine the system's architecture, design, and implementation approach. This phase involves creating detailed specifications, such as system architecture diagrams, [[database]] designs, and [[user interface]] mockups, to guide the development process.
3. Implementation or Coding: During this phase, developers write the code based on the specifications provided in the previous phase. They follow coding standards and best practices to ensure the code is modular, scalable, and maintainable. This phase often involves collaboration among developers and may include code reviews and testing to identify and fix defects early in the development process.
4. Testing: After the code is written, the testing phase begins. This involves executing test cases to verify that the [[software]] meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Testing may include various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the quality and reliability of the [[software]].
5. Deployment or Implementation: Once the [[software]] has been tested and validated, it is deployed to the production environment or released to end-users. This may involve installing the [[software]] on servers, distributing it to users, and providing training and support as needed. Deployment activities ensure that the [[software]] is available and accessible to its intended users.
6. Maintenance and Support: After the [[software]] is deployed, the maintenance phase begins. This involves monitoring the [[software]]'s performance, addressing any issues or bugs that arise, and making updates or enhancements as needed to meet changing requirements or address feedback from users. Maintenance activities help ensure the long-term reliability, stability, and usability of the [[software]].
