## Fundamental Definitions

* **Walk**: A walk represents a [[sequence]] of connected [[vertex|vertices]] and edges that begins and ends with a [[vertex]], serving as a fundamental traversal mechanism in [[graph theory]]. This concept allows [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and scientists to explore connectivity and movement through complex [[networks]] by tracing a path between points.

* **Trail**: A trail is a specific type of walk characterized by its unique constraint of not repeating any edges during traversal. This restriction provides a more structured approach to exploring [[graph]] connections, ensuring that each edge is visited only once while allowing vertices to be potentially revisited.

* **Circuit**: A circuit is a closed walk that maintains the same non-repetition rule as a trail, but returns to its starting point. This creates a complete loop through the [[graph]] where no edge is used more than once, offering insights into cyclic network behaviors and potential closed systems.

* **Path**: A path represents the most restricted form of walk, where not only are edges not repeated, but vertices are also unique except for the start and end points. This provides the most direct and efficient route between two points in a [[graph]], eliminating any unnecessary or redundant traversal.

* **Cycle**: A cycle is a specialized circuit that requires at least one complete loop and ensures that no [[vertex]] is repeated except for the initial and final vertices. This concept is crucial in understanding fundamental [[graph]] properties and identifying closed geometric structures in mathematical and scientific contexts.
