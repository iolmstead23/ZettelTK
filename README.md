# Zettelkasten Toolkit

This is a basic CLI for extracting data from a collection of index markdown files much like the system used with Obsidian.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed

```bash
python ./main.py
```

If you don't have a directory called ./zetteltk/data, you can create it and put your files there. I have included some example files from my own notes. After you have your notes saved in the correct directory you need to generate the initial analysis. You can gnenerate further reports by running the CLI again. Once the analysis is complete you can run the report generator to generate a markdown report.

TODO: Add question generation using the data from the analysis and the note contents
